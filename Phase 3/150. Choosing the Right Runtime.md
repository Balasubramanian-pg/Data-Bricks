# 150. Choosing the Right Runtime

Canonical documentation for 150. Choosing the Right Runtime. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 150. Choosing the Right Runtime exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of choosing the right runtime is to ensure that applications are executed in an environment that provides the necessary resources, libraries, and dependencies to function correctly and efficiently. The problem space includes selecting a runtime that meets the specific requirements of an application, considering factors such as performance, security, and compatibility. This involves evaluating different runtime options, including programming language runtimes, container runtimes, and serverless runtimes, to determine the best fit for a particular use case.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of choosing the right runtime involves understanding the different types of runtimes, their characteristics, and the factors that influence the selection process. This includes considering the application's requirements, the runtime's performance and security features, and the trade-offs between different runtime options. A mental model of the topic should include the following components: application requirements, runtime options, evaluation criteria, and selection process.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Runtime | A software environment that provides the necessary resources and libraries for an application to execute. |
| Runtime Environment | The combination of the runtime, operating system, and hardware that an application runs on. |
| Container Runtime | A runtime that provides a lightweight and isolated environment for applications to run in, using containers. |
| Serverless Runtime | A runtime that provides a managed environment for applications to run in, without the need to provision or manage servers. |
| Programming Language Runtime | A runtime that provides the necessary libraries and dependencies for a specific programming language to execute. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of choosing the right runtime include:
* **Application Requirements**: Understanding the specific needs of an application, including performance, security, and compatibility requirements.
* **Runtime Options**: Evaluating different runtime options, including programming language runtimes, container runtimes, and serverless runtimes.
* **Evaluation Criteria**: Establishing criteria for evaluating runtime options, including factors such as performance, security, and cost.
* **Selection Process**: Using the evaluation criteria to select the most suitable runtime for a particular application.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for choosing the right runtime involves the following steps:
1. Define application requirements
2. Evaluate runtime options
3. Establish evaluation criteria
4. Select the most suitable runtime
5. Test and validate the selected runtime

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for choosing the right runtime include:
* **Using a container runtime for microservices**: Container runtimes such as Docker are well-suited for microservices architectures, providing a lightweight and isolated environment for each service.
* **Using a serverless runtime for event-driven applications**: Serverless runtimes such as AWS Lambda are well-suited for event-driven applications, providing a managed environment and automatic scaling.
* **Using a programming language runtime for monolithic applications**: Programming language runtimes such as the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) are well-suited for monolithic applications, providing the necessary libraries and dependencies for the application to execute.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for choosing the right runtime include:
* **Using a runtime that is not optimized for the application's requirements**: Using a runtime that is not optimized for the application's requirements can result in poor performance, security vulnerabilities, and increased costs.
* **Not evaluating runtime options**: Failing to evaluate different runtime options can result in selecting a runtime that is not well-suited for the application, leading to poor performance and increased costs.
* **Not considering scalability and flexibility**: Failing to consider scalability and flexibility when selecting a runtime can result in a runtime that is not able to handle increased traffic or changing requirements.
