Canonical documentation for 142. Delta Lake Streaming Sources. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 142. Delta Lake Streaming Sources exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Delta Lake Streaming Sources is designed to provide a scalable and reliable way to handle streaming data in Delta Lake, addressing the challenges of handling high-volume and high-velocity data streams. The primary problem it addresses is the need for a fault-tolerant and efficient mechanism to ingest and process streaming data in real-time, while ensuring data consistency and integrity.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Delta Lake Streaming Sources is built on top of the Delta Lake storage layer and leverages the capabilities of Apache Spark to provide a unified batch and streaming processing engine. The conceptual model involves the following key components: streaming data sources, Delta Lake storage, and Spark processing engine. The streaming data sources generate continuous streams of data, which are then ingested into Delta Lake using the Spark processing engine.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Delta Lake | An open-source storage layer that provides a scalable and reliable way to store and manage data |
| Streaming Source | A data source that generates continuous streams of data, such as Kafka, Kinesis, or Flume |
| Spark Processing Engine | A unified batch and streaming processing engine that provides a scalable and efficient way to process data |
| Checkpointing | A mechanism that saves the state of the streaming query to a reliable storage system, allowing for fault-tolerant and restartable streaming processing |
| Micro-Batch | A small batch of data that is processed as a single unit, providing a trade-off between latency and throughput |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Delta Lake Streaming Sources include: 
1. **Streaming Data Ingestion**: The process of ingesting continuous streams of data into Delta Lake.
2. **Checkpointing and Fault Tolerance**: The mechanism of saving the state of the streaming query to provide fault-tolerant and restartable streaming processing.
3. **Micro-Batch Processing**: The processing of small batches of data as a single unit, providing a trade-off between latency and throughput.
4. **Unified Batch and Streaming Processing**: The ability to process both batch and streaming data using a single engine, providing a unified view of data processing.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Delta Lake Streaming Sources involves the following components: 
1. **Streaming Data Source**: The data source that generates continuous streams of data.
2. **Spark Processing Engine**: The unified batch and streaming processing engine that processes the streaming data.
3. **Delta Lake Storage**: The storage layer that stores the processed data.
4. **Checkpointing Mechanism**: The mechanism that saves the state of the streaming query to provide fault-tolerant and restartable streaming processing.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for Delta Lake Streaming Sources include: 
1. **Real-time Data Ingestion**: Ingesting streaming data into Delta Lake in real-time, providing up-to-date views of data.
2. **Event-Driven Processing**: Processing streaming data based on events, such as clicks, purchases, or sensor readings.
3. **Stream-Table Joins**: Joining streaming data with batch data to provide a unified view of data.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for Delta Lake Streaming Sources include: 
1. **Inconsistent Checkpointing**: Failing to save the state of the streaming query regularly, leading to data loss and processing failures.
2. **Inadequate Resource Allocation**: Failing to allocate sufficient resources to the Spark processing engine, leading to performance issues and processing delays.
3. **Lack of Monitoring and Alerting**: Failing to monitor and alert on streaming data processing, leading to undetected issues and data loss.
