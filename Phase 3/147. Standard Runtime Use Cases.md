# 147. Standard Runtime Use Cases

Canonical documentation for 147. Standard Runtime Use Cases. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 147. Standard Runtime Use Cases exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The primary purpose of 147. Standard Runtime Use Cases is to provide a standardized framework for managing and executing runtime processes in a consistent and efficient manner. This framework addresses the class of problems related to runtime environment management, including process execution, resource allocation, and error handling. By establishing a set of standard use cases, developers can ensure that their applications are compatible with a wide range of runtime environments and can be easily integrated with other systems.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual model of 147. Standard Runtime Use Cases revolves around the idea of a runtime environment as a container for executing processes. This environment provides a set of services and resources that enable processes to run efficiently and effectively. The standard use cases define a set of interactions between the runtime environment and the processes it executes, including process creation, execution, and termination. This model also includes concepts such as resource management, error handling, and security.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Runtime Environment | A container for executing processes, providing services and resources such as memory, CPU, and I/O devices. |
| Process | A self-contained execution unit that runs within a runtime environment, performing a specific task or set of tasks. |
| Resource | A component or service provided by the runtime environment, such as memory, CPU, or I/O devices. |
| Error Handling | The process of detecting, reporting, and recovering from errors that occur during process execution. |
| Security | The set of mechanisms and policies that protect the runtime environment and its resources from unauthorized access or malicious activity. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of 147. Standard Runtime Use Cases include:
* **Process Management**: The ability to create, execute, and terminate processes within the runtime environment.
* **Resource Management**: The ability to allocate and deallocate resources such as memory, CPU, and I/O devices.
* **Error Handling**: The ability to detect, report, and recover from errors that occur during process execution.
* **Security**: The ability to protect the runtime environment and its resources from unauthorized access or malicious activity.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for 147. Standard Runtime Use Cases consists of the following components:
* **Runtime Environment**: The container for executing processes, providing services and resources.
* **Process Manager**: The component responsible for creating, executing, and terminating processes.
* **Resource Manager**: The component responsible for allocating and deallocating resources.
* **Error Handler**: The component responsible for detecting, reporting, and recovering from errors.
* **Security Manager**: The component responsible for protecting the runtime environment and its resources.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in 147. Standard Runtime Use Cases include:
* **Process Creation**: Creating a new process within the runtime environment.
* **Process Execution**: Executing a process within the runtime environment.
* **Resource Allocation**: Allocating resources such as memory, CPU, or I/O devices to a process.
* **Error Handling**: Detecting, reporting, and recovering from errors that occur during process execution.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in 147. Standard Runtime Use Cases include:
* **Resource Leaks**: Failing to deallocate resources when they are no longer needed, leading to resource exhaustion.
* **Error Ignoring**: Ignoring errors that occur during process execution, leading to unpredictable behavior or crashes.
* **Security Vulnerabilities**: Failing to protect the runtime environment and its resources from unauthorized access or malicious activity.
