# 143. Delta Lake Streaming Sinks

Canonical documentation for 143. Delta Lake Streaming Sinks. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 143. Delta Lake Streaming Sinks exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Delta Lake Streaming Sinks are designed to address the challenges of handling high-volume, high-velocity, and high-variety data streams in real-time. The primary purpose of Delta Lake Streaming Sinks is to provide a scalable, fault-tolerant, and efficient way to ingest and process streaming data into Delta Lake, a popular open-source storage layer. The class of problems that Delta Lake Streaming Sinks addresses includes handling real-time data ingestion, providing exactly-once processing guarantees, and supporting a wide range of data sources and sinks.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of Delta Lake Streaming Sinks involves a high-level architecture that consists of a streaming data source, a stream processing engine, and a Delta Lake sink. The streaming data source generates a continuous flow of data, which is then processed by the stream processing engine. The processed data is then written to a Delta Lake table, which provides a scalable and efficient storage layer for the data. The Delta Lake sink is responsible for managing the data ingestion process, including handling errors, retries, and data consistency.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Delta Lake | An open-source storage layer that provides a scalable and efficient way to store and manage data |
| Streaming Data | A continuous flow of data that is generated by a streaming data source |
| Stream Processing Engine | A system that processes streaming data in real-time, providing features such as data transformation, aggregation, and filtering |
| Delta Lake Sink | A component that is responsible for writing processed streaming data to a Delta Lake table |
| Exactly-Once Processing | A guarantee that each data record is processed exactly once, even in the presence of failures or retries |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Delta Lake Streaming Sinks include:
* **Streaming Data Ingestion**: The process of ingesting streaming data into a Delta Lake table
* **Exactly-Once Processing**: The guarantee that each data record is processed exactly once, even in the presence of failures or retries
* **Data Consistency**: The ability to maintain data consistency across the streaming data source, stream processing engine, and Delta Lake sink
* **Scalability**: The ability to handle high-volume and high-velocity streaming data
* **Fault Tolerance**: The ability to handle failures and retries without losing data or compromising data consistency

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Delta Lake Streaming Sinks involves a micro-batch processing approach, where the streaming data is divided into small batches and processed in real-time. The processed data is then written to a Delta Lake table, which provides a scalable and efficient storage layer for the data. The standard model also includes features such as:
* **Checkpointing**: The ability to save the state of the stream processing engine at regular intervals, allowing for fault-tolerant processing
* **Watermarking**: The ability to track the progress of the streaming data and provide a guarantee of exactly-once processing
* **Data Versioning**: The ability to maintain multiple versions of the data, allowing for auditing and debugging purposes

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for Delta Lake Streaming Sinks include:
* **Real-time Data Ingestion**: Ingesting streaming data into a Delta Lake table in real-time, providing up-to-the-minute insights and analytics
* **Event-Driven Architecture**: Using Delta Lake Streaming Sinks as part of an event-driven architecture, where the streaming data is used to trigger events and actions
* **Data Integration**: Using Delta Lake Streaming Sinks to integrate data from multiple sources, providing a unified view of the data

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for Delta Lake Streaming Sinks include:
* **Batch Processing**: Processing streaming data in large batches, which can lead to delays and inefficiencies
* **At-Least-Once Processing**: Providing a guarantee that each data record is processed at least once, but not exactly once, which can lead to data duplication and inconsistencies
* **Lack of Checkpointing**: Failing to save the state of the stream processing engine at regular intervals, which can lead to data loss and inconsistencies in the event of a failure
