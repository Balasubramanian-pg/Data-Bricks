# 26. Spark APIs Overview

Canonical documentation for 26. Spark APIs Overview. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 26. Spark APIs Overview exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The Spark APIs Overview exists to provide a comprehensive understanding of the application programming interfaces (APIs) available in Apache Spark, a unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing. The class of problems it addresses includes big data processing, machine learning, and data analytics, providing a standardized framework for developers to build scalable and efficient data-driven applications.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Apache Spark provides a set of APIs that enable developers to build applications for processing large-scale data. The Spark APIs Overview provides a conceptual framework for understanding the different APIs available, including the Spark Core API, Spark SQL API, Spark Streaming API, Spark MLlib API, and Spark GraphX API. These APIs provide a range of functionality, from basic data processing to advanced machine learning and graph processing.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Apache Spark | An open-source, unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing |
| Spark Core API | The foundation of the Spark API, providing basic data processing functionality |
| Spark SQL API | A Spark API for working with structured and semi-structured data |
| Spark Streaming API | A Spark API for processing real-time data streams |
| Spark MLlib API | A Spark API for machine learning |
| Spark GraphX API | A Spark API for graph processing |
| Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD) | A fundamental data structure in Spark, representing a collection of elements that can be split across multiple nodes |
| DataFrame | A distributed collection of data organized into named columns, similar to a table in a relational database |
| Dataset | A distributed collection of data that can be manipulated using functional programming constructs |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of the Spark APIs include:
* **Data processing**: The ability to process large-scale data using a variety of APIs, including the Spark Core API, Spark SQL API, and Spark Streaming API.
* **Data structures**: The use of data structures such as RDDs, DataFrames, and Datasets to represent and manipulate data.
* **Functional programming**: The use of functional programming constructs, such as map, filter, and reduce, to process data.
* **Distributed computing**: The ability to scale data processing tasks across multiple nodes in a cluster.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for using the Spark APIs involves:
1. **Creating a SparkSession**: The entry point to programming Spark, providing access to the Spark Core API, Spark SQL API, and other APIs.
2. **Loading data**: Loading data into a Spark data structure, such as an RDD, DataFrame, or Dataset.
3. **Processing data**: Using the Spark APIs to process the data, such as filtering, mapping, and reducing.
4. **Storing data**: Storing the processed data in a file, database, or other data store.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns when using the Spark APIs include:
* **Data ingestion**: Loading data from a variety of sources, such as files, databases, and messaging systems.
* **Data transformation**: Transforming data from one format to another, such as converting CSV to JSON.
* **Data aggregation**: Aggregating data, such as grouping and counting.
* **Machine learning**: Using the Spark MLlib API to build and train machine learning models.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns when using the Spark APIs include:
* **Using RDDs for complex data processing**: While RDDs are a fundamental data structure in Spark, they are not always the best choice for complex data processing tasks.
* **Not optimizing data storage**: Failing to optimize data storage can lead to performance issues and increased storage costs.
* **Not monitoring and debugging**: Failing to monitor and debug Spark applications can lead to issues and downtime.
