Canonical documentation for 101. Time Travel Use Cases. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 101. Time Travel Use Cases exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of 101. Time Travel Use Cases is to provide a comprehensive framework for understanding and utilizing time travel in various contexts, including science fiction, theoretical physics, and hypothetical scenario planning. The problem space addressed by this topic includes the complexities and paradoxes associated with time travel, such as the grandfather paradox, the bootstrap paradox, and the potential consequences of altering historical events.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Time travel can be conceptualized as a means of moving through the timeline, either forward or backward, to a different point in space-time. This can be achieved through various methods, including wormholes, black holes, and exotic matter. The conceptual overview of time travel involves understanding the fundamental principles of time dilation, relativity, and the potential risks and benefits associated with altering the timeline.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Time Dilation | The phenomenon where time appears to pass at different rates for observers in different states of motion or gravitational fields. |
| Wormhole | A hypothetical shortcut through space-time, potentially connecting two distant points in the universe. |
| Grandfather Paradox | A thought experiment that illustrates the potential problems with backward time travel, where an individual travels back in time and kills their own grandfather before he has children, thereby preventing their own birth. |
| Novikov Self-Consistency Principle | A hypothesis that proposes any events that occur through time travel have already occurred and are therefore predetermined, ensuring that the timeline remains self-consistent. |
| Predestination | The idea that every event in history is predetermined and cannot be changed, including those that occur through time travel. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of time travel include the understanding of time dilation, relativity, and the potential consequences of altering the timeline. Additionally, the concept of the Novikov Self-Consistency Principle and predestination are essential in understanding the potential risks and benefits associated with time travel. The idea of a stable timeline, where events are predetermined and cannot be changed, is also a fundamental concept in time travel.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model of time travel involves the use of a wormhole or other exotic matter to create a shortcut through space-time, allowing for near-instantaneous travel between two distant points. This model also assumes the existence of a stable timeline, where events are predetermined and cannot be changed. The standard model takes into account the potential risks and benefits associated with time travel, including the grandfather paradox and the bootstrap paradox.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in time travel include the use of a time machine or vehicle to travel through the timeline, the existence of a multiverse or parallel universes, and the concept of a time traveler's journal or log to record events and experiences. Additionally, the idea of a time travel agency or organization that regulates and oversees time travel is a common pattern in science fiction.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in time travel include the use of time travel for personal gain or to alter historical events for selfish purposes. Additionally, the creation of paradoxes or logical inconsistencies through time travel is discouraged, as it can have unforeseen consequences on the timeline. The use of time travel to kill or harm individuals, including one's own ancestors, is also a discouraged practice.
