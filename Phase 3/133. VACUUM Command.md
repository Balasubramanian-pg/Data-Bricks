# 133. VACUUM Command

Canonical documentation for 133. VACUUM Command. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
The 133. VACUUM Command exists to address the need for efficient database maintenance, specifically in removing dead tuples and reclaiming storage space. It targets the class of problems related to database performance degradation due to bloat, which can occur after a large number of insert, update, and delete operations. The command is designed to prevent disk space from becoming fragmented and to maintain optimal database performance.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
At a high level, the 133. VACUUM Command is a database maintenance utility that reclaims storage occupied by dead tuples. Dead tuples are rows that have been deleted or superseded by later updates. By removing these tuples, the command frees up disk space, reducing the size of the database and improving query performance. The process involves scanning the database, identifying dead tuples, and reclaiming their storage space.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Dead Tuple | A row in a database table that has been deleted or superseded by a later update. |
| Tuple | A row in a database table. |
| Bloat | The growth of a database due to the accumulation of dead tuples, leading to performance degradation. |
| VACUUM | A command used to reclaim storage space occupied by dead tuples in a database. |
| Fragmentation | A condition where free space in a database is broken into small, non-contiguous blocks, reducing efficiency. |

## 4. Core Concepts
The core concepts of the 133. VACUUM Command include:
- **Dead Tuple Identification**: The process of finding rows in the database that are no longer valid.
- **Storage Reclamation**: The act of freeing up disk space previously occupied by dead tuples.
- **Database Scanning**: The process of examining the database to identify areas where the VACUUM command can be applied.
- **Transaction Id Wraparound**: A condition that can occur if a database is not properly maintained, leading to data loss.

## 5. Standard Model
The standard model for using the 133. VACUUM Command involves running it periodically as part of regular database maintenance. This can be done manually or automated through scheduling tools. The command can be run in different modes, such as `VACUUM` for standard reclamation and `VACUUM FULL` for a more thorough but resource-intensive process.

## 6. Common Patterns
Common patterns for using the 133. VACUUM Command include:
- **Regular Maintenance**: Scheduling the command to run at regular intervals to prevent bloat.
- **Post-Bulk Operations**: Running the command after bulk insert, update, or delete operations to reclaim space.
- **Monitoring Database Size**: Regularly checking the size of the database and running the command as needed.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Anti-patterns to avoid when using the 133. VACUUM Command include:
- **Running VACUUM Too Frequently**: This can lead to unnecessary overhead and impact database performance.
- **Not Running VACUUM**: Failing to run the command regularly can result in significant database bloat and performance issues.
- **Using VACUUM FULL Unnecessarily**: This mode is resource-intensive and should only be used when absolutely necessary.
