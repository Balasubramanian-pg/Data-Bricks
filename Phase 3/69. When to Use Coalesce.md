# 69. When to Use Coalesce

Canonical documentation for 69. When to Use Coalesce. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 69. When to Use Coalesce exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The Coalesce function is used to handle null or missing values in a dataset, providing a way to replace them with a specified value. This is particularly useful in database queries, data analysis, and programming, where null values can cause errors or unexpected behavior. The purpose of Coalesce is to ensure that data is handled consistently and reliably, even when some values are missing.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The Coalesce function takes a list of arguments and returns the first non-null value. It is often used in SQL queries, programming languages, and data manipulation tools to handle null or missing values. The conceptual model of Coalesce involves a simple, sequential evaluation of arguments, where the function returns the first value that is not null.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Coalesce | A function that returns the first non-null value from a list of arguments |
| Null | A value that represents the absence of any object value |
| Argument | A value passed to a function or procedure |
| SQL | Structured Query Language, a language used for managing relational databases |
| Dataset | A collection of data, often stored in a database or spreadsheet |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Coalesce include:
* Handling null or missing values in a dataset
* Providing a default or fallback value when a primary value is null
* Ensuring consistent and reliable data handling
* Using a simple, sequential evaluation of arguments to determine the return value

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for using Coalesce involves the following best practices:
* Use Coalesce to handle null or missing values in a dataset
* Specify a default or fallback value as the last argument to the Coalesce function
* Ensure that the Coalesce function is used consistently throughout a database or application
* Test and validate the use of Coalesce to ensure that it is working as expected

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for using Coalesce include:
* Using Coalesce to provide a default value for a column in a SQL query
* Using Coalesce to handle null values in a programming language, such as Java or Python
* Using Coalesce to replace missing values in a dataset with a specified value
* Using Coalesce in combination with other functions, such as IFNULL or ISNULL, to handle complex data handling scenarios

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for using Coalesce include:
* Using Coalesce as a substitute for proper data validation or error handling
* Overusing Coalesce, which can lead to complex and difficult-to-maintain code
* Failing to test and validate the use of Coalesce, which can lead to unexpected behavior or errors
* Using Coalesce to hide or ignore underlying data quality issues, rather than addressing the root cause of the problem
