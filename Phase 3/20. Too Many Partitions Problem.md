# 20. Too Many Partitions Problem

Canonical documentation for 20. Too Many Partitions Problem. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
The 20. Too Many Partitions Problem exists due to the limitations imposed by certain file systems and operating systems, which can only support a maximum of 20 or 24 partitions per disk device. This problem addresses the class of issues that arise when attempting to create more partitions than the supported limit, resulting in errors, data loss, or system instability. The purpose of this documentation is to provide guidance on understanding, mitigating, and resolving the Too Many Partitions Problem.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
The Too Many Partitions Problem is a constraint imposed by the design of certain file systems and operating systems. It is a high-level issue that affects the organization and management of disk space, leading to limitations in the number of partitions that can be created. This problem can be understood as a trade-off between the need for multiple partitions and the technical limitations of the underlying system.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Partition | A logical division of a disk device, used to organize and manage data |
| File System | A system for organizing and storing files on a disk device |
| Operating System | A software component that manages computer hardware and provides services to applications |
| Disk Device | A physical storage device, such as a hard drive or solid-state drive |
| MBR | Master Boot Record, a type of partition table used by some operating systems |

## 4. Core Concepts
The fundamental ideas that form the basis of the Too Many Partitions Problem are:
* The concept of partitions as logical divisions of a disk device
* The limitations imposed by file systems and operating systems on the number of partitions that can be created
* The use of partition tables, such as MBR, to manage and organize partitions
* The potential consequences of exceeding the partition limit, including errors, data loss, and system instability

## 5. Standard Model
The standard model for addressing the Too Many Partitions Problem involves:
* Using a limited number of partitions, typically fewer than 20 or 24, depending on the file system and operating system
* Utilizing alternative storage solutions, such as logical volume management (LVM) or disk pooling, to manage disk space
* Implementing partition management best practices, such as regular backups and disk maintenance

## 6. Common Patterns
Common patterns for addressing the Too Many Partitions Problem include:
* Using a single, large partition for data storage
* Creating a limited number of partitions for specific purposes, such as operating system installation or swap space
* Implementing a hierarchical directory structure to organize data within a single partition

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Common but discouraged practices for addressing the Too Many Partitions Problem include:
* Creating an excessive number of small partitions, leading to fragmentation and decreased performance
* Using outdated or unsupported file systems and operating systems that exacerbate the partition limit
* Failing to implement regular backups and disk maintenance, increasing the risk of data loss and system instability
