> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 55. Join Types Inner Outer Left Right exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of Join Types Inner Outer Left Right is to provide a standardized approach to combining data from multiple sources based on common attributes. This exists to address the problem of data integration and analysis, where different data sources need to be combined to extract meaningful insights. The class of problems it addresses includes data merging, data integration, and data analysis.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Join Types Inner Outer Left Right refers to the different ways to combine data from two or more tables based on a common column. The main concept is to join two tables based on a common attribute, resulting in a new table that contains data from both tables. The different join types (Inner, Outer, Left, Right) determine which data is included in the resulting table.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Inner Join | A join that returns only the rows that have a match in both tables. |
| Outer Join | A join that returns all rows from both tables, with null values in the columns where there are no matches. |
| Left Join | A join that returns all rows from the left table and the matching rows from the right table. If there are no matches, the result will contain null values. |
| Right Join | A join that returns all rows from the right table and the matching rows from the left table. If there are no matches, the result will contain null values. |
| Table | A collection of related data, organized into rows and columns. |
| Column | A vertical element in a table that contains a specific type of data. |
| Row | A horizontal element in a table that contains a single record of data. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Join Types Inner Outer Left Right include:
* Combining data from multiple tables based on common attributes
* Using different join types to determine which data is included in the resulting table
* Handling null values in the resulting table
* Understanding the differences between Inner, Outer, Left, and Right joins

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Join Types Inner Outer Left Right involves using the following steps:
1. Identify the common attribute between the two tables
2. Choose the appropriate join type (Inner, Outer, Left, Right) based on the desired outcome
3. Combine the data from both tables using the chosen join type
4. Handle null values in the resulting table as needed

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for Join Types Inner Outer Left Right include:
* Using Inner Joins to retrieve data that exists in both tables
* Using Outer Joins to retrieve all data from both tables, with null values where there are no matches
* Using Left Joins to retrieve all data from the left table and the matching data from the right table
* Using Right Joins to retrieve all data from the right table and the matching data from the left table

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for Join Types Inner Outer Left Right include:
* Using the wrong join type for the desired outcome, resulting in incorrect or incomplete data
* Failing to handle null values in the resulting table, leading to errors or inconsistencies
* Not optimizing join operations for performance, resulting in slow query execution
