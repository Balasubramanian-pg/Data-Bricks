Canonical documentation for 103. Auditing with Time Travel. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 103. Auditing with Time Travel exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of 103. Auditing with Time Travel is to provide a robust and efficient method for tracking changes to data over time, enabling the reconstruction of past states and facilitating auditing, compliance, and debugging. This approach addresses the class of problems related to data integrity, security, and accountability, particularly in environments where data is frequently updated or modified.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Auditing with Time Travel involves creating a temporal record of all changes to data, allowing for the ability to "travel" back in time to examine the state of the data at any given point. This is achieved through the use of versioning, logging, and snapshotting mechanisms, which collectively enable the reconstruction of past states and the tracking of changes over time.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Time Travel | The ability to examine the state of data at a previous point in time. |
| Audit Trail | A record of all changes made to data over time. |
| Versioning | The process of assigning a unique identifier to each version of data. |
| Snapshot | A copy of the data at a particular point in time. |
| Logging | The process of recording all changes to data in a log file. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Auditing with Time Travel include:
* **Immutability**: Data is never deleted or modified, only appended or added to.
* **Versioning**: Each change to data is assigned a unique version identifier.
* **Logging**: All changes to data are recorded in a log file.
* **Snapshotting**: Periodic copies of the data are taken to facilitate time travel.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Auditing with Time Travel involves the following components:
* **Data Store**: A repository for storing data.
* **Versioning System**: A mechanism for assigning unique version identifiers to each change.
* **Log File**: A record of all changes to data.
* **Snapshot Store**: A repository for storing periodic copies of the data.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in Auditing with Time Travel include:
* **Periodic Snapshots**: Taking regular copies of the data to facilitate time travel.
* **Real-time Logging**: Recording all changes to data in real-time.
* **Version-based Querying**: Querying data based on version identifiers.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in Auditing with Time Travel include:
* **Data Overwriting**: Modifying or deleting data without preserving a record of the change.
* **Inconsistent Logging**: Failing to record all changes to data in a consistent and reliable manner.
* **Inadequate Versioning**: Failing to assign unique version identifiers to each change.
