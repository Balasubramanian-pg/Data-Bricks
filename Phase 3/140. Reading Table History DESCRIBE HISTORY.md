## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 140. Reading Table History DESCRIBE HISTORY exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of 140. Reading Table History DESCRIBE HISTORY is to provide a standardized method for retrieving and analyzing the historical data stored in a table, addressing the need for efficient data retrieval, analysis, and auditing. This functionality is essential in various applications, including data warehousing, business intelligence, and compliance monitoring, where the ability to track changes and understand data evolution over time is crucial.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual model of 140. Reading Table History DESCRIBE HISTORY revolves around the idea of maintaining a record of all changes made to a table's data over time. This includes inserts, updates, and deletes, allowing for the reconstruction of the table's state at any point in the past. The model encompasses the storage of historical data, the management of different versions of data records, and the provision of mechanisms to query and analyze this historical information.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Table History | A record of all changes made to a table's data over time. |
| Historical Data | The stored data that represents the state of the table at previous points in time. |
| Versioning | The process of managing different versions of data records to track changes. |
| DESCRIBE HISTORY | A command or operation used to retrieve and analyze the historical data of a table. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of 140. Reading Table History DESCRIBE HISTORY include:
- **Data Versioning**: The ability to store and manage multiple versions of data records.
- **Change Tracking**: The process of recording all changes (inserts, updates, deletes) made to the data.
- **Historical Data Retrieval**: The capability to retrieve and reconstruct the state of the data at any point in the past.
- **Data Analysis**: The ability to analyze historical data for auditing, compliance, or business intelligence purposes.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for 140. Reading Table History DESCRIBE HISTORY involves:
1. **Data Storage**: Historical data is stored in a structured format, often in the same database as the current data or in a dedicated data warehouse.
2. **Version Management**: A versioning system is used to manage different versions of data records, ensuring that each change is uniquely identified and timestamped.
3. **Query Interface**: A query interface, such as SQL, is provided to allow users to retrieve and analyze historical data using commands like DESCRIBE HISTORY.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns include:
- **Auditing and Compliance**: Using historical data to track changes for auditing and compliance purposes.
- **Data Analytics**: Analyzing historical data to understand trends and patterns over time.
- **Data Recovery**: Utilizing historical data to recover from data loss or corruption.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns include:
- **Manual Change Tracking**: Manually tracking changes outside of a versioning system, which can lead to inaccuracies and inefficiencies.
- **Inadequate Data Storage**: Failing to allocate sufficient storage for historical data, leading to data loss or significant performance issues.
- **Lack of Access Control**: Failing to implement proper access controls, potentially exposing sensitive historical data to unauthorized access.
