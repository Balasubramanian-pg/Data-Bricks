Canonical documentation for 60. Actions That Trigger Execution. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 60. Actions That Trigger Execution exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of 60. Actions That Trigger Execution is to provide a standardized framework for identifying and managing the actions that initiate the execution of a process, system, or application. This topic addresses the class of problems related to understanding the triggers that set off a chain of events, enabling the design of more efficient, reliable, and maintainable systems.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual model of 60. Actions That Trigger Execution revolves around the idea that every execution has a starting point, which is an action or event that sets the process in motion. This action can be a user interaction, a scheduled task, a sensor reading, or any other type of trigger. Understanding these actions is crucial for designing and optimizing systems, as it allows developers to anticipate and prepare for the execution of the process.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Trigger | An event or action that initiates the execution of a process or system. |
| Action | A specific activity or event that occurs within a system or process. |
| Execution | The carrying out or performance of a process, system, or application. |
| Initiator | The entity or component that sets off the trigger, starting the execution of a process. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of 60. Actions That Trigger Execution include:
* **Trigger identification**: The process of determining the specific actions or events that initiate the execution of a process or system.
* **Action classification**: The categorization of actions into different types, such as user-initiated, system-initiated, or scheduled actions.
* **Execution flow**: The sequence of events that occurs after a trigger is activated, leading to the execution of a process or system.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for 60. Actions That Trigger Execution involves the following components:
1. **Trigger detection**: Identifying the specific actions or events that initiate the execution of a process or system.
2. **Action processing**: Handling the trigger event and preparing the system for execution.
3. **Execution initiation**: Starting the execution of the process or system in response to the trigger.
4. **Execution monitoring**: Tracking the progress and status of the executing process or system.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in 60. Actions That Trigger Execution include:
* **User-initiated execution**: A user interacts with a system or application, triggering the execution of a process.
* **Scheduled execution**: A system or application is configured to execute a process at a predetermined time or interval.
* **Event-driven execution**: A system or application executes a process in response to a specific event or trigger.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in 60. Actions That Trigger Execution include:
* **Tight coupling**: Overly rigid connections between components, making it difficult to modify or replace triggers.
* **Trigger duplication**: Multiple triggers that initiate the same execution, leading to redundant or conflicting actions.
* **Lack of trigger documentation**: Insufficient or missing documentation of triggers, making it challenging to understand and maintain the system.
