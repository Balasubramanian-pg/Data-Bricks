Canonical documentation for 139. Gold Layer Aggregations. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 139. Gold Layer Aggregations exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The Gold Layer Aggregations standard is designed to address the complexities of data integration and analysis in multi-layered systems. It provides a framework for aggregating and processing data from various sources, enabling efficient and accurate decision-making. The primary problem space addressed by Gold Layer Aggregations includes data siloing, inconsistent data formats, and the need for real-time insights.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Gold Layer Aggregations can be conceptualized as a hierarchical framework consisting of multiple layers, each representing a different level of data granularity. The lowest layer comprises raw, unprocessed data, while subsequent layers apply increasingly complex aggregation and processing techniques. This hierarchical structure enables the derivation of meaningful insights and patterns from large, disparate datasets.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Aggregation Layer | A logical grouping of data processing and aggregation operations |
| Data Source | An origin of raw, unprocessed data |
| Gold Layer | The highest level of aggregation, representing the most refined and processed data |
| Data Silo | A isolated repository of data, often characterized by inconsistent formats and limited accessibility |
| ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) | A process for extracting data from sources, transforming it into a standardized format, and loading it into a target system |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts underlying Gold Layer Aggregations include:
* Data integration: combining data from multiple sources into a unified view
* Data aggregation: applying operations to combine and summarize data
* Data processing: transforming and refining data to extract insights and patterns
* Hierarchical modeling: organizing data into a layered structure to facilitate progressive refinement and analysis

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Gold Layer Aggregations consists of the following layers:
1. Data Ingestion Layer: responsible for collecting and processing raw data from various sources
2. Data Transformation Layer: applies standardization and formatting operations to the ingested data
3. Data Aggregation Layer: performs summary and grouping operations to derive intermediate insights
4. Data Analysis Layer: applies advanced analytics and machine learning techniques to extract refined insights
5. Gold Layer: represents the highest level of aggregation, providing real-time, actionable insights

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in Gold Layer Aggregations include:
* Using ETL processes to integrate and transform data from multiple sources
* Applying data aggregation techniques, such as grouping and summarization, to derive intermediate insights
* Utilizing data visualization tools to represent complex data insights in an intuitive and accessible manner

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in Gold Layer Aggregations include:
* Data siloing: isolating data in separate, inaccessible repositories
* Inconsistent data formatting: failing to standardize data formats across sources and systems
* Insufficient data processing: neglecting to apply necessary transformation and aggregation operations to extract meaningful insights
