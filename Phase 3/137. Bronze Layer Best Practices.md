Canonical documentation for 137. Bronze Layer Best Practices. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 137. Bronze Layer Best Practices exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The Bronze Layer Best Practices exist to provide a standardized approach to data warehousing and data integration, addressing the complexities and challenges associated with managing large datasets, ensuring data quality, and optimizing data processing. The class of problems it addresses includes data inconsistencies, data duplication, and data processing inefficiencies.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The Bronze Layer is a critical component of a data warehousing architecture, serving as the initial landing zone for raw, unprocessed data. It is responsible for ingesting, storing, and processing large volumes of data from various sources, providing a foundation for downstream data transformation, aggregation, and analysis.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Bronze Layer | The initial landing zone for raw, unprocessed data in a data warehousing architecture |
| Data Ingestion | The process of collecting, transporting, and loading data from various sources into the Bronze Layer |
| Data Processing | The act of transforming, aggregating, and refining data in the Bronze Layer to prepare it for downstream analysis |
| Data Quality | The measure of data accuracy, completeness, and consistency, ensuring that data is reliable and trustworthy |
| Data Lineage | The record of data origin, processing, and transformation, providing transparency and accountability |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of the Bronze Layer Best Practices include data ingestion, data processing, data quality, and data lineage. These concepts are interconnected and interdependent, forming the foundation of a robust and reliable data warehousing architecture.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for the Bronze Layer includes the following components:
* Data Ingestion: Utilize a scalable and fault-tolerant data ingestion framework to collect data from various sources.
* Data Storage: Employ a distributed and scalable storage solution to store raw, unprocessed data.
* Data Processing: Leverage a flexible and efficient data processing engine to transform, aggregate, and refine data.
* Data Quality: Implement a robust data quality framework to ensure data accuracy, completeness, and consistency.
* Data Lineage: Maintain a comprehensive record of data origin, processing, and transformation.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in the Bronze Layer include:
* Using a lambda architecture to handle large volumes of data and provide real-time processing capabilities.
* Implementing a data validation framework to ensure data quality and consistency.
* Utilizing a data catalog to provide metadata management and data discovery capabilities.
* Employing a scalable and flexible data processing engine to handle diverse data sources and processing requirements.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in the Bronze Layer include:
* Using a single, monolithic data storage solution that lacks scalability and flexibility.
* Implementing a rigid and inflexible data processing framework that cannot adapt to changing requirements.
* Neglecting data quality and data lineage, leading to data inconsistencies and lack of transparency.
* Failing to implement a robust data security framework, compromising data confidentiality and integrity.
