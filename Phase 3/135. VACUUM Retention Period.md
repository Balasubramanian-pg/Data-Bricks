# 135. VACUUM Retention Period

Canonical documentation for 135. VACUUM Retention Period. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
The 135. VACUUM Retention Period exists to address the need for a standardized approach to managing data retention in vacuum systems, particularly in environments where data storage and management are critical. The class of problems it addresses includes data loss, corruption, and inconsistencies that can arise from inadequate retention policies. By establishing a clear retention period, organizations can ensure that their data is properly preserved, backed up, and recoverable in the event of a failure or disaster.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
The 135. VACUUM Retention Period is based on the concept of a standardized time frame during which data is retained in a vacuum system. This time frame is designed to balance the need for data preservation with the need for efficient data management and storage. The conceptual model involves identifying the types of data that require retention, determining the appropriate retention period, and implementing policies and procedures to ensure compliance.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Retention Period | The length of time that data is retained in a vacuum system. |
| Data Type | A category of data that requires retention, such as system logs, user data, or configuration files. |
| Vacuum System | A system that uses vacuum technology to store and manage data. |
| Data Preservation | The process of protecting data from loss, corruption, or degradation. |
| Compliance | Adherence to established policies, procedures, and regulations regarding data retention. |

## 4. Core Concepts
The fundamental ideas that form the basis of the 135. VACUUM Retention Period include:
* Data classification: identifying the types of data that require retention
* Retention period determination: establishing the appropriate length of time for data retention
* Policy implementation: developing and enforcing policies and procedures for data retention
* Compliance monitoring: ensuring adherence to established policies and procedures

## 5. Standard Model
The standard model for the 135. VACUUM Retention Period involves a tiered approach to data retention, with different retention periods for different types of data. The model includes:
* Short-term retention (less than 30 days) for transient data
* Medium-term retention (30 days to 1 year) for operational data
* Long-term retention (more than 1 year) for archival data

## 6. Common Patterns
Common patterns for implementing the 135. VACUUM Retention Period include:
* Automated data backup and archiving
* Regular data purging and deletion
* Data encryption and access controls
* Compliance monitoring and reporting

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Common but discouraged practices include:
* Inconsistent or inadequate data retention policies
* Insufficient data backup and archiving
* Failure to monitor and enforce compliance
* Inadequate data encryption and access controls
