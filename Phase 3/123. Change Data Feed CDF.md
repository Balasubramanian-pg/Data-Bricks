Canonical documentation for 123. Change Data Feed CDF. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 123. Change Data Feed CDF exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The Change Data Feed (CDF) is a crucial component in data integration and synchronization, designed to capture and propagate changes made to data in real-time. It exists to address the challenges of maintaining data consistency and integrity across multiple systems, applications, and databases. The primary problem space CDF targets includes data duplication, inconsistencies, and latency issues that arise from traditional data replication methods. By providing a streamlined and efficient way to identify, capture, and deliver changes, CDF enables organizations to improve their data management capabilities, enhance decision-making, and reduce operational costs.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
At its core, the Change Data Feed is a mechanism that monitors a source system for any changes (inserts, updates, deletes) made to the data and then captures these changes in a structured format. This structured change data is then fed into a target system, which can be another database, data warehouse, or application, ensuring that the data remains up-to-date and consistent across all systems. The CDF operates by leveraging log-based change data capture techniques, which read the transaction logs of the source database to identify changes, or through trigger-based methods that capture changes at the point of data modification.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Change Data Capture (CDC) | The process of capturing changes made to data in a database and delivering these changes in real-time to target systems. |
| Source System | The original system or database where data changes occur. |
| Target System | The system or database that receives the captured changes from the source system. |
| Transaction Log | A record of all changes made to a database, used by CDF to identify and capture data changes. |
| Data Consistency | The state of data being accurate, complete, and uniform across all systems and applications. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Change Data Feed include:
- **Change Data Capture (CDC):** The foundation of CDF, which involves identifying and extracting changes from the source system.
- **Real-time Data Integration:** The ability to integrate changed data into target systems as soon as the changes occur, ensuring real-time data consistency.
- **Data Transformation:** The process of converting captured data into a format compatible with the target system, if necessary.
- **Data Delivery:** The mechanism by which captured and possibly transformed data is fed into the target system.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for implementing a Change Data Feed involves the following steps:
1. **Identify Source and Target Systems:** Determine which systems will act as the source and target for the data changes.
2. **Choose a CDC Method:** Select a suitable change data capture method, such as log-based or trigger-based, depending on the source system's capabilities and requirements.
3. **Configure CDF:** Set up the CDF tool or service, specifying the source and target systems, the data to be captured, and any necessary transformations.
4. **Implement Data Transformation (if needed):** Convert the captured data into the required format for the target system.
5. **Deliver Changed Data:** Feed the captured and transformed data into the target system, ensuring real-time data synchronization.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in using Change Data Feed include:
- **Real-time Analytics:** Feeding changed data into analytics systems for immediate insights.
- **Data Warehousing:** Capturing changes and loading them into a data warehouse for historical analysis.
- **Microservices Integration:** Using CDF to synchronize data across microservices in a distributed application architecture.
- **Cloud Migration:** Leveraging CDF to migrate data from on-premise systems to cloud-based systems in real-time.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns to avoid when implementing Change Data Feed include:
- **Batch Processing:** Processing changes in batches rather than in real-time, leading to data latency.
- **Manual Data Synchronization:** Manually updating data across systems, which is error-prone and inefficient.
- **Not Accounting for Data Transformations:** Failing to consider the need for data transformations, leading to compatibility issues between source and target systems.
