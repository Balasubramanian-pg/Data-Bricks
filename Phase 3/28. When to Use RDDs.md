# 28. When to Use RDDs

Canonical documentation for 28. When to Use RDDs. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 28. When to Use RDDs exists and the class of problems it addresses.
RDDs (Resilient Distributed Datasets) are a fundamental data structure in Apache Spark, designed to efficiently handle large-scale data processing. The primary purpose of RDDs is to provide a flexible, fault-tolerant, and scalable way to process massive amounts of data in a distributed computing environment. The class of problems that RDDs address includes big data processing, data integration, data transformation, and data analysis.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
At a high level, RDDs can be thought of as a collection of elements that can be split across multiple nodes in a cluster, allowing for parallel processing and fault tolerance. RDDs are created by loading data from a variety of sources, such as files, databases, or other RDDs, and can be transformed and manipulated using a variety of operations, such as map, filter, and reduce.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| RDD | Resilient Distributed Dataset, a fundamental data structure in Apache Spark |
| Dataset | A collection of data, which can be split across multiple nodes in a cluster |
| Partition | A subset of an RDD, which is processed on a single node in the cluster |
| Transformation | An operation that creates a new RDD from an existing one, such as map or filter |
| Action | An operation that returns a value or side effect, such as reduce or collect |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of RDDs include:
* **Immutability**: RDDs are immutable, meaning that once created, they cannot be modified.
* **Lazy Evaluation**: RDDs are evaluated lazily, meaning that computations are only performed when an action is invoked.
* **Caching**: RDDs can be cached in memory, allowing for faster access and processing.
* **Partitioning**: RDDs can be partitioned across multiple nodes in a cluster, allowing for parallel processing.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for using RDDs involves:
1. Creating an RDD from a data source, such as a file or database.
2. Transforming the RDD using operations such as map, filter, and reduce.
3. Caching the RDD in memory to improve performance.
4. Invoking an action on the RDD, such as collect or save, to produce a result or side effect.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for using RDDs include:
* **Data ingestion**: Using RDDs to load data from a variety of sources, such as files, databases, or other RDDs.
* **Data transformation**: Using RDDs to transform and manipulate data, such as aggregating, filtering, or mapping.
* **Data analysis**: Using RDDs to analyze data, such as computing statistics or performing machine learning algorithms.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for using RDDs include:
* **Overusing cache**: Caching too many RDDs can lead to memory issues and decreased performance.
* **Underusing partitioning**: Failing to partition RDDs can lead to decreased performance and increased memory usage.
* **Using too many small RDDs**: Creating too many small RDDs can lead to decreased performance and increased overhead.
