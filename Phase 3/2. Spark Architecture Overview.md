# 2. Spark Architecture Overview

Canonical documentation for 2. Spark Architecture Overview. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 2. Spark Architecture Overview exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The Spark Architecture Overview exists to provide a comprehensive understanding of the Apache Spark ecosystem, addressing the class of problems related to big data processing, analytics, and machine learning. It aims to provide a unified framework for developers, data scientists, and engineers to design, implement, and optimize Spark-based applications, thereby improving the efficiency, scalability, and reliability of data-intensive workloads.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The Spark Architecture Overview is centered around the concept of a unified analytics engine that can handle various workloads, including batch processing, interactive queries, and real-time streaming. It consists of several key components, including the Spark Core, Spark SQL, Spark Streaming, Spark MLlib, and Spark GraphX, which work together to provide a comprehensive platform for data processing, analytics, and machine learning.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Apache Spark | An open-source unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing |
| Spark Core | The foundation of the Spark ecosystem, providing basic functionality for task scheduling, memory management, and data storage |
| Spark SQL | A module for working with structured and semi-structured data, providing support for SQL queries and DataFrames |
| Spark Streaming | A module for processing real-time data streams, providing support for event-time processing and windowed operations |
| Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD) | A fundamental data structure in Spark, representing a collection of elements that can be split across multiple nodes in the cluster |
| DataFrame | A distributed collection of data organized into named columns, similar to a table in a relational database |
| Dataset | A strongly-typed, object-oriented API for working with structured data, providing support for compile-time type safety and runtime optimization |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of the Spark Architecture Overview include:
* **Data Parallelism**: Spark's ability to process large datasets in parallel across multiple nodes in the cluster, improving performance and scalability.
* **In-Memory Computation**: Spark's ability to store and process data in memory, reducing the need for disk I/O and improving performance.
* **Lazy Evaluation**: Spark's ability to delay the execution of tasks until the results are actually needed, improving performance and reducing unnecessary computation.
* **Catalyst Optimizer**: Spark's cost-based optimizer, which generates efficient execution plans for Spark SQL queries and DataFrames.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Spark Architecture consists of the following layers:
* **Data Ingestion**: Data is ingested into the Spark ecosystem through various sources, such as files, databases, or messaging systems.
* **Data Processing**: Data is processed using Spark's various modules, including Spark Core, Spark SQL, Spark Streaming, and Spark MLlib.
* **Data Storage**: Processed data is stored in a variety of formats, including Parquet, Avro, and JSON.
* **Data Analytics**: Data is analyzed using Spark's various APIs, including Spark SQL, DataFrames, and Datasets.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in Spark Architecture include:
* **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)**: Data is extracted from various sources, transformed into a suitable format, and loaded into a target system.
* **Data Warehousing**: Data is stored in a centralized repository, providing a single source of truth for analytics and reporting.
* **Real-Time Analytics**: Data is processed and analyzed in real-time, providing immediate insights and decision-making capabilities.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in Spark Architecture include:
* **Over-Engineering**: Overly complex architectures that are difficult to maintain and optimize.
* **Under-Utilization**: Underutilization of Spark's capabilities, leading to inefficient processing and storage of data.
* **Lack of Monitoring**: Failure to monitor and optimize Spark applications, leading to performance issues and downtime.
