# 24. Executor Memory Configuration

Canonical documentation for 24. Executor Memory Configuration. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 24. Executor Memory Configuration exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The Executor Memory Configuration exists to provide a standardized approach to managing memory allocation for executors, which are responsible for executing tasks in a distributed computing environment. The primary problem it addresses is the need to optimize memory usage to prevent out-of-memory errors, reduce latency, and improve overall system performance. By configuring executor memory effectively, developers can ensure that their applications can handle large workloads and scale efficiently.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The Executor Memory Configuration involves setting parameters that control the amount of memory allocated to executors, such as the initial memory allocation, maximum memory allocation, and memory overhead. This configuration is typically done at the application or cluster level and may involve trade-offs between memory usage, performance, and latency. The goal is to find an optimal balance between these factors to ensure reliable and efficient execution of tasks.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Executor | A process or thread that executes tasks in a distributed computing environment. |
| Memory Allocation | The amount of memory assigned to an executor for task execution. |
| Initial Memory Allocation | The initial amount of memory allocated to an executor when it starts. |
| Maximum Memory Allocation | The maximum amount of memory that can be allocated to an executor. |
| Memory Overhead | The additional memory required by an executor for overhead tasks, such as garbage collection. |
| Out-of-Memory Error | An error that occurs when an executor runs out of memory and cannot allocate more. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Executor Memory Configuration include:
* **Memory allocation**: The process of assigning memory to executors for task execution.
* **Memory management**: The process of monitoring and controlling memory usage to prevent out-of-memory errors.
* **Performance optimization**: The process of adjusting memory configuration to achieve optimal performance and latency.
* **Scalability**: The ability of the system to handle increased workloads by adjusting memory configuration.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Executor Memory Configuration involves setting the following parameters:
* Initial memory allocation: 1-2 GB
* Maximum memory allocation: 4-8 GB
* Memory overhead: 10-20% of the initial memory allocation
This model provides a balanced approach to memory configuration, allowing for efficient task execution while minimizing the risk of out-of-memory errors.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for Executor Memory Configuration include:
* **Dynamic memory allocation**: Adjusting memory allocation based on workload demand.
* **Memory pooling**: Sharing memory between multiple executors to reduce memory overhead.
* **Caching**: Storing frequently accessed data in memory to reduce latency.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for Executor Memory Configuration include:
* **Over-allocation**: Allocating too much memory to executors, leading to waste and reduced performance.
* **Under-allocation**: Allocating too little memory to executors, leading to out-of-memory errors and reduced performance.
* **Static memory allocation**: Failing to adjust memory allocation based on changing workload demands.
