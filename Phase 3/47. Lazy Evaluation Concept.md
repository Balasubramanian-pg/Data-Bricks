Canonical documentation for 47. Lazy Evaluation Concept. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 47. Lazy Evaluation Concept exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The Lazy Evaluation Concept exists to optimize computational resource utilization by delaying the evaluation of expressions until their values are actually needed. This concept addresses the class of problems related to performance, memory usage, and responsiveness in programming, particularly in scenarios where computations are expensive or unnecessary.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Lazy evaluation is a programming paradigm that defers the evaluation of an expression until its value is required. This approach enables more efficient use of computational resources, as unnecessary computations are avoided. The conceptual model of lazy evaluation involves wrapping expressions in a layer of indirection, which allows the system to track and manage the evaluation of these expressions.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Lazy Expression | An expression that is not evaluated immediately when it is bound to a variable or passed to a function. |
| Thunk | A closure that wraps an expression and delays its evaluation until the thunk is forced. |
| Memoization | The process of caching the results of expensive function calls so that they can be reused instead of recomputed. |
| Strict Evaluation | The traditional evaluation strategy where expressions are evaluated immediately when they are bound to a variable or passed to a function. |
| Non-strict Evaluation | An evaluation strategy where expressions are not evaluated until their values are actually needed. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of lazy evaluation include:
* **Delayed evaluation**: Expressions are not evaluated until their values are required.
* **Thunks**: Closures that wrap expressions and delay their evaluation.
* **Forcing**: The process of evaluating a thunk to obtain its value.
* **Memoization**: Caching the results of expensive function calls to avoid recomputation.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model of lazy evaluation involves using thunks to wrap expressions and delay their evaluation. When a thunk is forced, the wrapped expression is evaluated, and the result is cached to avoid recomputation. This model is widely adopted in functional programming languages, such as Haskell, where it is used to optimize performance and memory usage.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in lazy evaluation include:
* **Lazy data structures**: Data structures that are constructed on demand, rather than upfront.
* **Lazy function calls**: Function calls that are delayed until their results are actually needed.
* **Memoized functions**: Functions that cache their results to avoid recomputation.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in lazy evaluation include:
* **Unnecessary strictness**: Using strict evaluation when lazy evaluation would be more efficient.
* **Over-eager evaluation**: Evaluating expressions too early, which can lead to unnecessary computations.
* **Insufficient memoization**: Failing to cache the results of expensive function calls, which can lead to recomputation.
