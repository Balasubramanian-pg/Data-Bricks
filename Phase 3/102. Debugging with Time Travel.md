# 102. Debugging with Time Travel

Canonical documentation for 102. Debugging with Time Travel. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 102. Debugging with Time Travel exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The primary purpose of 102. Debugging with Time Travel is to provide developers with a robust and efficient method for identifying and resolving complex issues in their codebases. This technique addresses the class of problems related to debugging, where traditional methods may fall short due to the complexity, non-determinism, or rarity of the issues. By leveraging time travel, developers can navigate through the execution history of their program, inspecting and analyzing the state of the system at various points in time, thereby facilitating the identification of the root cause of the problem.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual model of 102. Debugging with Time Travel revolves around the idea of navigating through the execution history of a program, much like traveling through time. This is achieved by recording the state of the system at regular intervals, creating a timeline of events that can be traversed and inspected. The developer can then use this timeline to identify the point in time where the issue occurred, analyze the state of the system, and debug the problem.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Time Travel | The ability to navigate through the execution history of a program, inspecting and analyzing the state of the system at various points in time. |
| Execution History | A record of the state of the system at regular intervals, creating a timeline of events that can be traversed and inspected. |
| Timeline | A sequence of events that represent the execution history of a program. |
| Checkpoint | A point in time where the state of the system is recorded, allowing for navigation and inspection. |
| Debugging Session | A period of time during which a developer uses time travel to identify and resolve issues in their codebase. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of 102. Debugging with Time Travel include:
* **Recording execution history**: The process of capturing the state of the system at regular intervals, creating a timeline of events.
* **Navigating the timeline**: The ability to move through the execution history, inspecting and analyzing the state of the system at various points in time.
* **Inspecting system state**: The process of examining the state of the system at a particular point in time, including variables, data structures, and other relevant information.
* **Analyzing execution flow**: The process of understanding the sequence of events that led to a particular point in time, including function calls, conditional statements, and other control flow mechanisms.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for 102. Debugging with Time Travel involves the following components:
* **Recorder**: A component responsible for capturing the state of the system at regular intervals, creating a timeline of events.
* **Navigator**: A component that allows the developer to move through the execution history, inspecting and analyzing the state of the system at various points in time.
* **Inspector**: A component that provides detailed information about the state of the system at a particular point in time, including variables, data structures, and other relevant information.
* **Analyzer**: A component that helps the developer understand the sequence of events that led to a particular point in time, including function calls, conditional statements, and other control flow mechanisms.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in 102. Debugging with Time Travel include:
* **Forward debugging**: The process of navigating through the execution history in a forward direction, inspecting and analyzing the state of the system at each point in time.
* **Backward debugging**: The process of navigating through the execution history in a backward direction, inspecting and analyzing the state of the system at each point in time.
* **Checkpoint-based debugging**: The process of using checkpoints to navigate through the execution history, inspecting and analyzing the state of the system at each checkpoint.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in 102. Debugging with Time Travel include:
* **Excessive checkpointing**: Creating too many checkpoints, resulting in a large and cumbersome timeline that is difficult to navigate.
* **Insufficient checkpointing**: Creating too few checkpoints, resulting in a lack of detail and making it difficult to identify the root cause of the issue.
* **Over-reliance on automation**: Relying too heavily on automated debugging tools, rather than using time travel to manually inspect and analyze the state of the system.
