# 39. Global Temporary Views

Canonical documentation for 39. Global Temporary Views. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 39. Global Temporary Views exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Global Temporary Views exist to provide a shared, temporary storage mechanism for data that can be accessed by multiple sessions or queries within a database system. The primary problem space addressed by Global Temporary Views is the need for a temporary, session-independent storage mechanism that can be used to store and manage data that is not persisted across sessions. This is particularly useful in scenarios where data needs to be shared between multiple queries or sessions, but does not need to be persisted long-term.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Global Temporary Views can be thought of as a hybrid between a regular view and a temporary table. Like a regular view, a Global Temporary View is a virtual table based on the result of a query. However, unlike a regular view, a Global Temporary View is stored in memory and is only available for the duration of the session that created it. This provides the benefits of a temporary table, such as improved performance and reduced storage requirements, while also providing the flexibility and ease of use of a regular view.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Global Temporary View | A temporary, virtual table that is stored in memory and can be accessed by multiple sessions or queries within a database system. |
| Session | A single connection to a database system, which can execute one or more queries. |
| Temporary Table | A physical table that is stored in memory and is only available for the duration of the session that created it. |
| View | A virtual table based on the result of a query, which can be used to simplify complex queries or provide an additional layer of abstraction. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Global Temporary Views include:
* **Session independence**: Global Temporary Views are stored in memory and are only available for the duration of the session that created them.
* **Temporary storage**: Global Temporary Views are stored in memory, which provides improved performance and reduced storage requirements compared to traditional tables.
* **Virtual tables**: Global Temporary Views are virtual tables based on the result of a query, which provides flexibility and ease of use.
* **Shared access**: Global Temporary Views can be accessed by multiple sessions or queries within a database system.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Global Temporary Views involves creating a temporary view using a query, and then accessing the view using standard SQL syntax. The view is stored in memory and is only available for the duration of the session that created it. The standard model also involves using a naming convention that indicates the view is temporary and global, such as prefixing the view name with "GT_".

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for using Global Temporary Views include:
* **Data transformation**: Using Global Temporary Views to transform data from one format to another, such as aggregating data or performing calculations.
* **Data sharing**: Using Global Temporary Views to share data between multiple sessions or queries within a database system.
* **Performance optimization**: Using Global Temporary Views to improve performance by reducing the amount of data that needs to be stored or retrieved.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Common anti-patterns for using Global Temporary Views include:
* **Overusing Global Temporary Views**: Using Global Temporary Views as a replacement for traditional tables, rather than as a temporary storage mechanism.
* **Not properly cleaning up**: Failing to properly clean up Global Temporary Views after they are no longer needed, which can lead to memory leaks and performance issues.
* **Using Global Temporary Views for long-term storage**: Using Global Temporary Views to store data long-term, rather than using traditional tables.
