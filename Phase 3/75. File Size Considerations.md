## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 75. File Size Considerations exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of file size considerations is to ensure that digital files are optimized for storage, transmission, and processing, while maintaining their intended quality and functionality. This topic addresses the class of problems related to file size management, including storage capacity limitations, transfer time delays, and computational resource constraints.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
File size considerations involve a trade-off between file quality, compression, and storage/transmission efficiency. It requires understanding the relationships between file formats, compression algorithms, and the resulting file size. This topic encompasses various aspects, including file type, compression level, encoding schemes, and optimization techniques.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| File Size | The amount of digital storage space required to store a file, typically measured in bytes (B), kilobytes (KB), megabytes (MB), or gigabytes (GB). |
| Compression | The process of reducing the size of a file while preserving its original content, using algorithms such as lossless or lossy compression. |
| Optimization | The process of modifying a file to reduce its size while maintaining its intended quality and functionality. |
| Encoding Scheme | A set of rules or protocols used to convert data into a digital format, such as text, image, or video encoding. |
| Bitrate | The rate at which bits are transmitted or processed, often used to measure the quality of audio or video files. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of file size considerations include:
* Understanding file formats and their associated file sizes
* Applying compression algorithms to reduce file size
* Optimizing files for specific use cases, such as web or mobile applications
* Balancing file quality and file size to meet performance and storage requirements
* Using encoding schemes and bitrate settings to control file size and quality

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for file size considerations involves a step-by-step approach:
1. Determine the required file quality and functionality
2. Select an appropriate file format and encoding scheme
3. Apply compression algorithms to reduce file size
4. Optimize the file for the intended use case
5. Verify the resulting file size and quality

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in file size considerations include:
* Using lossless compression for text and image files
* Applying lossy compression for audio and video files
* Optimizing files for web and mobile applications using techniques such as image resizing and caching
* Using bitrate settings to control the quality of audio and video files

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in file size considerations include:
* Using unnecessary or excessive compression, resulting in reduced file quality
* Failing to optimize files for specific use cases, leading to inefficient storage and transmission
* Ignoring file size limitations, resulting in storage capacity issues or transfer time delays
* Using outdated or inefficient encoding schemes, leading to larger file sizes and reduced compatibility
