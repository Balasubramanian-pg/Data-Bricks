Canonical documentation for 52. groupBy Transformation. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 52. groupBy Transformation exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The groupBy transformation is a fundamental operation in data processing that enables the grouping of data based on one or more common attributes. It exists to address the problem of organizing and summarizing large datasets by categorizing them into smaller, more manageable groups. This allows for efficient analysis, aggregation, and filtering of data, making it a crucial component in various data processing pipelines, including data warehousing, business intelligence, and data science applications.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The groupBy transformation can be conceptualized as a two-step process: 
1. **Partitioning**: The data is divided into partitions based on the specified grouping criteria.
2. **Aggregation**: Each partition is then processed to produce a summary or aggregated output.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Grouping Key | A set of one or more attributes used to determine the groups. |
| Group | A subset of the data that shares the same value for the grouping key. |
| Aggregate Function | A function applied to each group to produce a summary value, such as SUM, COUNT, or AVG. |
| Transformation | The process of applying the groupBy operation to the input data. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of the groupBy transformation include:
- **Grouping**: The process of categorizing data into groups based on common attributes.
- **Aggregation**: The application of functions to each group to produce summary values.
- **Partitioning**: The division of data into smaller, more manageable subsets based on the grouping criteria.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for the groupBy transformation involves the following steps:
1. **Data Input**: The data to be processed is received.
2. **Grouping Key Specification**: The attributes to be used for grouping are specified.
3. **Partitioning**: The data is partitioned based on the grouping key.
4. **Aggregation**: Aggregate functions are applied to each partition.
5. **Output**: The aggregated results are produced.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for the groupBy transformation include:
- **Data Summarization**: Using groupBy to summarize large datasets by aggregating values such as sums, counts, or averages.
- **Data Filtering**: Applying filters to the grouped data to select specific subsets for further analysis.
- **Data Analysis**: Utilizing groupBy as a precursor to more complex data analysis tasks, such as data mining or predictive modeling.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for the groupBy transformation include:
- **Inefficient Grouping**: Using too many or too few grouping keys, leading to inefficient partitioning and aggregation.
- **Incorrect Aggregate Functions**: Applying inappropriate aggregate functions to the data, resulting in misleading or incorrect results.
- **Insufficient Data Preparation**: Failing to properly clean, transform, or handle missing data before applying the groupBy transformation.
