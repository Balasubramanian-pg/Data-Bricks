Canonical documentation for 70. Partitioning Data for Writes. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 70. Partitioning Data for Writes exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The primary purpose of partitioning data for writes is to improve the scalability, performance, and reliability of data storage systems by dividing data into smaller, more manageable pieces. This approach addresses the problems of data growth, increased write traffic, and the need for high availability in modern data systems. By partitioning data, systems can distribute write operations across multiple nodes or storage devices, reducing contention and improving overall throughput.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Partitioning data for writes involves dividing a large dataset into smaller, independent pieces called partitions. Each partition contains a subset of the overall data and is typically stored on a separate node or device. This allows write operations to be directed to specific partitions, reducing competition for resources and improving system performance. The partitioning scheme can be based on various criteria, such as data range, hash values, or geographic location.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Partition | A subset of the overall data, typically stored on a separate node or device. |
| Partition Key | A value or attribute used to determine which partition a piece of data belongs to. |
| Partition Scheme | The algorithm or methodology used to divide data into partitions. |
| Shard | A subset of data that is stored on a separate node or device, often used interchangeably with partition. |
| Data Distribution | The process of allocating data across multiple partitions or nodes. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of partitioning data for writes include:
* **Data division**: Dividing data into smaller, independent pieces to improve scalability and performance.
* **Partitioning schemes**: Using algorithms or methodologies to determine which partition a piece of data belongs to.
* **Data distribution**: Allocating data across multiple partitions or nodes to improve system reliability and availability.
* **Load balancing**: Distributing write operations across multiple partitions or nodes to improve system performance.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for partitioning data for writes involves the following components:
* **Data ingestion**: Data is ingested into the system and prepared for partitioning.
* **Partitioning**: Data is divided into partitions based on a partitioning scheme.
* **Data storage**: Partitions are stored on separate nodes or devices.
* **Data retrieval**: Data is retrieved from partitions as needed.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for partitioning data for writes include:
* **Range-based partitioning**: Partitioning data based on a range of values, such as date or ID.
* **Hash-based partitioning**: Partitioning data based on a hash value, such as a user ID or IP address.
* **List-based partitioning**: Partitioning data based on a list of values, such as a list of countries or cities.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for partitioning data for writes include:
* **Over-partitioning**: Creating too many partitions, leading to increased complexity and reduced performance.
* **Under-partitioning**: Creating too few partitions, leading to reduced scalability and performance.
* **Inconsistent partitioning**: Using inconsistent partitioning schemes, leading to data inconsistencies and errors.
