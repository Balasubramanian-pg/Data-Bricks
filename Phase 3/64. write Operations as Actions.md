Canonical documentation for 64. write Operations as Actions. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 64. write Operations as Actions exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of writing operations as actions is to provide a clear, concise, and standardized way of expressing complex operations in a system. This approach addresses the problem of ambiguity and confusion that can arise when operations are described in a vague or overly technical manner. By writing operations as actions, developers can ensure that their code is easy to understand, maintain, and extend.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual model of writing operations as actions involves breaking down complex operations into discrete, actionable steps. Each step is described in a clear and concise manner, using a standard set of terminology and notation. This approach enables developers to think about operations in a more modular and composable way, making it easier to design, implement, and test complex systems.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Action | A discrete, executable step that performs a specific operation |
| Operation | A complex task that can be broken down into one or more actions |
| Actor | The entity that performs an action, such as a user or a system component |
| Precondition | A condition that must be met before an action can be performed |
| Postcondition | A condition that is guaranteed to be true after an action has been performed |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of writing operations as actions include:
* **Action-oriented thinking**: breaking down complex operations into discrete, actionable steps
* **Standardized notation**: using a consistent notation to describe actions and operations
* **Modularity**: designing operations as modular, composable components
* **Testability**: ensuring that operations can be tested and validated independently

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for writing operations as actions involves the following steps:
1. Identify the operation to be performed
2. Break down the operation into discrete actions
3. Describe each action in a clear and concise manner, using standardized notation
4. Specify the preconditions and postconditions for each action
5. Validate and test each action independently

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for writing operations as actions include:
* **Create-Read-Update-Delete (CRUD)**: a pattern for managing data entities
* **Request-Response**: a pattern for handling user requests and responses
* **Pipeline processing**: a pattern for processing data in a series of stages

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for writing operations as actions include:
* **God object**: a single, monolithic operation that performs multiple, unrelated tasks
* **Spaghetti code**: a complex, tangled web of operations and actions that are difficult to understand and maintain
* **Magic strings**: using hardcoded, undocumented strings to perform operations
