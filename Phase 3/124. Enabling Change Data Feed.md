Canonical documentation for 124. Enabling Change Data Feed. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 124. Enabling Change Data Feed exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The Change Data Feed (CDF) is a crucial component in modern data architectures, enabling real-time data integration and synchronization across disparate systems. It addresses the problem of data silos, inconsistencies, and latency by providing a unified, streaming interface for capturing and propagating changes to data. The primary purpose of CDF is to facilitate event-driven architectures, where applications can react to changes in data as they occur, rather than relying on periodic polling or batch processing.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The Change Data Feed can be conceptualized as a pipeline that captures changes to data from various sources, transforms them into a standardized format, and streams them to target systems in real-time. This pipeline typically consists of three primary components: (1) Change Data Capture (CDC), which extracts changes from source systems; (2) Data Transformation, which converts the captured changes into a standardized format; and (3) Data Streaming, which propagates the transformed changes to target systems.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Change Data Capture (CDC) | The process of identifying and extracting changes to data from source systems. |
| Change Data Feed (CDF) | A streaming interface that provides a unified view of changes to data from various sources. |
| Data Transformation | The process of converting captured changes into a standardized format for consumption by target systems. |
| Data Streaming | The process of propagating transformed changes to target systems in real-time. |
| Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) | A software architecture pattern that emphasizes the production, detection, and consumption of events. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Change Data Feed include: (1) **Change Detection**, which involves identifying changes to data in source systems; (2) **Data Standardization**, which ensures that changes are represented in a consistent format; (3) **Streaming**, which enables real-time propagation of changes to target systems; and (4) **Event-Driven Processing**, which enables applications to react to changes in data as they occur.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Change Data Feed typically involves the following components: (1) **Source Systems**, which generate changes to data; (2) **Change Data Capture (CDC) Tools**, which extract changes from source systems; (3) **Data Transformation Engines**, which convert captured changes into a standardized format; (4) **Message Queues or Streaming Platforms**, which propagate transformed changes to target systems; and (5) **Target Systems**, which consume the streamed changes.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for implementing Change Data Feed include: (1) **Database-to-Database Replication**, where changes are replicated from one database to another; (2) **Database-to-Message-Queue**, where changes are streamed from a database to a message queue; and (3) **Microservices-Based Integration**, where changes are propagated between microservices using a combination of CDC, data transformation, and streaming.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for Change Data Feed include: (1) **Periodic Polling**, where changes are detected by periodically querying source systems; (2) **Batch Processing**, where changes are processed in batches rather than in real-time; and (3) **Tight Coupling**, where source and target systems are tightly coupled, making it difficult to evolve or replace either system.
