> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 22. Partition Skew Issues exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Partition Skew Issues arise in distributed databases and big data processing systems where data is divided into partitions for parallel processing. The purpose of addressing Partition Skew Issues is to ensure efficient and balanced data distribution across partitions, preventing performance bottlenecks and data processing delays. The problem space includes scenarios where uneven data distribution leads to skewed partitions, resulting in decreased system performance, increased latency, and reduced overall throughput.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Partition Skew Issues occur when the data distribution across partitions becomes imbalanced, causing some partitions to process significantly more data than others. This imbalance can lead to performance degradation, as the slower partitions become bottlenecks in the processing pipeline. The conceptual model involves understanding the factors that contribute to partition skew, such as data distribution, partitioning schemes, and query patterns, and developing strategies to mitigate these issues.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Partition | A subset of data stored on a single node or processing unit. |
| Partition Skew | The phenomenon of uneven data distribution across partitions, leading to performance imbalances. |
| Data Distribution | The way data is divided and allocated across partitions. |
| Partitioning Scheme | A method or algorithm used to divide data into partitions. |
| Query Pattern | The characteristic of a query that affects data access and processing patterns. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Partition Skew Issues include understanding the factors that contribute to partition skew, such as:
* Data distribution and partitioning schemes
* Query patterns and data access methods
* System architecture and resource allocation
* Performance metrics and monitoring techniques
These concepts form the foundation for developing strategies to mitigate partition skew and ensure efficient data processing.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for addressing Partition Skew Issues involves a combination of the following:
* Data partitioning schemes, such as range-based or hash-based partitioning
* Dynamic partitioning and repartitioning techniques
* Data redistribution and rebalancing algorithms
* Query optimization and rewriting techniques
* Performance monitoring and feedback mechanisms

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for addressing Partition Skew Issues include:
* Using range-based partitioning for datasets with ordered or sequential data
* Implementing hash-based partitioning for datasets with random or uniform data
* Utilizing dynamic partitioning and repartitioning techniques to adapt to changing data distributions
* Applying query optimization and rewriting techniques to reduce data processing imbalances

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for addressing Partition Skew Issues include:
* Using a single, static partitioning scheme for all datasets and workloads
* Ignoring data distribution and query patterns when designing partitioning schemes
* Failing to monitor and address performance imbalances and partition skew
* Over-relying on manual data redistribution and rebalancing techniques
