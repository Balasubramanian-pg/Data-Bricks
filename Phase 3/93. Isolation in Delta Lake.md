# 93. Isolation in Delta Lake

Canonical documentation for 93. Isolation in Delta Lake. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 93. Isolation in Delta Lake exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Isolation in Delta Lake is designed to address the challenges of concurrent data access and modification in a distributed data storage system. It provides a mechanism to ensure data consistency and integrity by controlling how multiple users or processes interact with the data. The primary problem space that isolation in Delta Lake addresses includes preventing data inconsistencies, ensuring data freshness, and providing a consistent view of the data to all users.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Isolation in Delta Lake can be thought of as a set of rules that govern how multiple transactions interact with the data. It ensures that each transaction sees a consistent view of the data and that the effects of one transaction are not visible to other transactions until it is committed. This is achieved through the use of locking mechanisms, transactional logs, and versioning.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Isolation Level | The degree to which a transaction is isolated from the effects of other transactions. |
| Transaction | A sequence of operations that are executed as a single, all-or-nothing unit of work. |
| Locking | A mechanism used to prevent multiple transactions from accessing the same data simultaneously. |
| Versioning | A mechanism used to track changes to the data and ensure that each transaction sees a consistent view of the data. |
| Snapshot Isolation | A level of isolation that ensures each transaction sees a consistent view of the data as it existed at the start of the transaction. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of isolation in Delta Lake include:
* **Transactional isolation**: ensuring that each transaction is executed independently and consistently.
* **Concurrency control**: managing multiple transactions that access the same data simultaneously.
* **Data consistency**: ensuring that the data remains in a consistent state despite concurrent modifications.
* **Versioning and snapshotting**: tracking changes to the data and providing a consistent view of the data to each transaction.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for isolation in Delta Lake is based on the principles of transactional isolation and concurrency control. It uses a combination of locking mechanisms, transactional logs, and versioning to ensure that each transaction is executed independently and consistently. The model includes the following components:
* **Transaction manager**: responsible for managing transactions and ensuring that they are executed correctly.
* **Lock manager**: responsible for managing locks and ensuring that transactions do not interfere with each other.
* **Version manager**: responsible for tracking changes to the data and providing a consistent view of the data to each transaction.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for isolation in Delta Lake include:
* **Read-committed isolation**: ensuring that each transaction sees a consistent view of the data as it existed at the start of the transaction.
* **Read-uncommitted isolation**: allowing transactions to see the effects of other transactions before they are committed.
* **Serializable isolation**: ensuring that transactions are executed in a way that is equivalent to a serial execution.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for isolation in Delta Lake include:
* **Using low isolation levels**: using isolation levels that do not provide sufficient protection against data inconsistencies.
* **Not using transactions**: not using transactions to manage data modifications, leading to data inconsistencies and errors.
* **Not managing locks**: not managing locks correctly, leading to deadlocks and other concurrency-related issues.
