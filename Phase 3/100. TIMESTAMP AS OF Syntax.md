# 100. TIMESTAMP AS OF Syntax

Canonical documentation for 100. TIMESTAMP AS OF Syntax. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 100. TIMESTAMP AS OF Syntax exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The TIMESTAMP AS OF syntax is designed to provide a way to query data as it existed at a specific point in time, addressing the need for temporal data analysis and auditing. This syntax enables users to retrieve data from a previous state, allowing for historical analysis, data recovery, and compliance with regulatory requirements.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The TIMESTAMP AS OF syntax operates on the concept of a temporal database, where each row has a timestamp associated with it. This timestamp represents the point in time when the data was last modified. By specifying a timestamp, users can query the database as it existed at that specific point in time, effectively creating a snapshot of the data.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Timestamp | A point in time associated with a row in the database, representing the last modification time. |
| AS OF | A clause used to specify the timestamp for the query, indicating the point in time for which the data should be retrieved. |
| Temporal Database | A database that stores data with associated timestamps, enabling temporal queries and analysis. |
| Snapshot | A view of the data at a specific point in time, created by querying the database using the TIMESTAMP AS OF syntax. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of the TIMESTAMP AS OF syntax include:
* Temporal data management: The ability to store and manage data with associated timestamps.
* Timestamp-based querying: The ability to query data based on a specific timestamp.
* Data versioning: The ability to retrieve previous versions of data.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for using the TIMESTAMP AS OF syntax involves the following steps:
1. Create a temporal database with timestamp-enabled tables.
2. Insert or update data with associated timestamps.
3. Use the TIMESTAMP AS OF clause to query the data at a specific point in time.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for using the TIMESTAMP AS OF syntax include:
* Auditing and compliance: Using the syntax to retrieve historical data for auditing and compliance purposes.
* Data recovery: Using the syntax to recover data from a previous state.
* Temporal analysis: Using the syntax to analyze data over time.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for using the TIMESTAMP AS OF syntax include:
* Using the syntax as a substitute for proper data backup and recovery procedures.
* Failing to properly manage timestamp data, leading to inconsistencies and errors.
* Using the syntax to query large datasets without proper optimization, leading to performance issues.
