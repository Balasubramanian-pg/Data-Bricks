# 126. CDF Use Cases

Canonical documentation for 126. CDF Use Cases. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 126. CDF Use Cases exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The 126. CDF Use Cases exist to provide a standardized framework for representing and exchanging data between different systems, applications, and organizations. The primary problem space addressed by 126. CDF Use Cases is the lack of interoperability and consistency in data representation, which hinders the efficient exchange and utilization of data. This leads to increased costs, reduced data quality, and limited insights. The 126. CDF Use Cases aim to mitigate these issues by establishing a common language and set of use cases for data representation and exchange.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The 126. CDF Use Cases can be conceptualized as a set of predefined, reusable patterns for representing and exchanging data. These patterns are designed to capture the core characteristics and relationships of various data entities, enabling consistent and unambiguous data representation. The conceptual model consists of three primary components: data entities, relationships, and attributes. Data entities represent the core concepts or objects being described, relationships define the connections between entities, and attributes provide additional context and details about the entities.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| CDF | Canonical Data Format, a standardized framework for representing and exchanging data |
| Data Entity | A core concept or object being described, such as a customer or product |
| Relationship | A connection between two or more data entities, such as a customer-order relationship |
| Attribute | A characteristic or property of a data entity, such as a customer's name or address |
| Use Case | A specific scenario or pattern for representing and exchanging data, such as customer information or order details |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of 126. CDF Use Cases include data entities, relationships, attributes, and use cases. Data entities are the foundation of the framework, representing the core concepts or objects being described. Relationships define the connections between entities, enabling the creation of complex data models. Attributes provide additional context and details about the entities, while use cases define specific scenarios or patterns for representing and exchanging data.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for 126. CDF Use Cases consists of a hierarchical structure, with data entities at the top level, followed by relationships, and then attributes. This structure enables the creation of complex data models that capture the nuances and complexities of various data entities. The standard model also includes a set of predefined use cases, which provide a starting point for representing and exchanging data.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in 126. CDF Use Cases include the use of standardized data entities, such as customer or product, and the establishment of relationships between these entities. Another common pattern is the use of attributes to provide additional context and details about the entities. Additionally, many organizations use a combination of use cases to represent and exchange data, such as customer information and order details.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Common anti-patterns in 126. CDF Use Cases include the use of proprietary or customized data formats, which can lead to interoperability issues and reduced data quality. Another anti-pattern is the failure to establish clear relationships between data entities, resulting in ambiguous or inconsistent data representation. Additionally, the use of inadequate or incomplete attributes can lead to reduced data quality and limited insights.
