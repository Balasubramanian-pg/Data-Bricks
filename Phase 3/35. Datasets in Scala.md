# 35. Datasets in Scala

Canonical documentation for 35. Datasets in Scala. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 35. Datasets in Scala exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Datasets in Scala exist to provide a unified, type-safe, and efficient way to handle large-scale data processing. The primary problem space addressed by Datasets in Scala is the need for a high-level, expressive API that can efficiently process and analyze large datasets. This is particularly important in big data processing, where traditional data processing methods may not be sufficient. Datasets in Scala aim to bridge the gap between high-level APIs and low-level optimizations, providing a robust and scalable solution for data-intensive applications.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of Datasets in Scala revolves around the idea of a unified data processing API that integrates the benefits of both DataFrames and RDDs (Resilient Distributed Datasets). Datasets in Scala provide a type-safe, object-oriented API that allows developers to work with structured and semi-structured data in a more intuitive and efficient way. This high-level API abstracts away the underlying complexities of data processing, enabling developers to focus on the logic of their applications rather than the intricacies of data manipulation.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Dataset | A collection of data that can be processed in a distributed manner, providing a type-safe and object-oriented API. |
| DataFrame | A distributed collection of data organized into named columns, similar to a table in a relational database. |
| RDD | A Resilient Distributed Dataset, a fundamental data structure in Apache Spark that represents a collection of elements that can be split across nodes in the cluster for parallel processing. |
| Type Safety | The guarantee that the types of data being processed are known at compile-time, preventing type-related errors at runtime. |
| Catalyst Optimizer | A high-level optimization framework in Apache Spark that provides a robust and extensible way to optimize data processing pipelines. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Datasets in Scala include:
- **Type Safety**: Datasets in Scala provide a type-safe API, ensuring that the types of data being processed are known at compile-time.
- **Object-Oriented API**: Datasets in Scala offer an object-oriented API that allows developers to work with data in a more intuitive and expressive way.
- **Unified Data Processing**: Datasets in Scala integrate the benefits of both DataFrames and RDDs, providing a unified API for data processing.
- **Catalyst Optimizer**: Datasets in Scala leverage the Catalyst optimizer to provide high-level optimizations and improve the performance of data processing pipelines.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Datasets in Scala involves using the `Dataset` API to create and manipulate datasets, and leveraging the `DataFrame` API for structured data processing. This model recommends using the type-safe and object-oriented API provided by Datasets in Scala to define data processing pipelines, and relying on the Catalyst optimizer to optimize the performance of these pipelines.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns when working with Datasets in Scala include:
- **Data Ingestion**: Using the `Dataset` API to read data from various sources, such as files, databases, or messaging systems.
- **Data Transformation**: Applying transformations to datasets using the `map`, `filter`, and `aggregate` methods.
- **Data Aggregation**: Using the `groupBy` and `agg` methods to perform aggregations on datasets.
- **Data Output**: Writing datasets to various sinks, such as files, databases, or messaging systems.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns when working with Datasets in Scala include:
- **Using RDDs Directly**: Bypassing the `Dataset` API and working directly with RDDs, which can lead to type-unsafe code and decreased performance.
- **Not Using Type Safety**: Ignoring the type-safe features of the `Dataset` API, which can result in type-related errors at runtime.
- **Not Optimizing Data Processing Pipelines**: Failing to leverage the Catalyst optimizer to optimize data processing pipelines, which can lead to decreased performance and increased latency.
