Canonical documentation for 59. Join Optimization Strategies. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 59. Join Optimization Strategies exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of Join Optimization Strategies is to improve the efficiency and performance of join operations in database queries. Join operations combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column, and optimizing these operations is crucial for reducing query execution time and improving overall system performance. The problem space addressed by Join Optimization Strategies includes reducing the computational cost of join operations, minimizing disk I/O, and optimizing memory usage.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Join Optimization Strategies involve a set of techniques and algorithms used to optimize the join operation in database queries. The conceptual overview of Join Optimization Strategies includes understanding the different types of join operations, such as inner joins, outer joins, and semi-joins, as well as the various optimization techniques, including reordering joins, using indexes, and applying join algorithms such as hash join and sort-merge join.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Join Operation | A database operation that combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column. |
| Join Order | The order in which tables are joined in a query. |
| Join Algorithm | A method used to perform a join operation, such as hash join or sort-merge join. |
| Index | A data structure used to improve the speed of data retrieval by providing a quick way to locate specific data. |
| Query Optimization | The process of selecting the most efficient execution plan for a query. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Join Optimization Strategies include understanding the different types of join operations, join algorithms, and optimization techniques. Key concepts include:
* Reordering joins to reduce the number of rows being joined
* Using indexes to improve the speed of data retrieval
* Applying join algorithms such as hash join and sort-merge join
* Optimizing memory usage and reducing disk I/O

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Join Optimization Strategies involves a combination of the following steps:
1. Analyzing the query and identifying the join operations
2. Reordering the joins to reduce the number of rows being joined
3. Applying join algorithms such as hash join or sort-merge join
4. Using indexes to improve the speed of data retrieval
5. Optimizing memory usage and reducing disk I/O

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in Join Optimization Strategies include:
* Using hash join for equi-joins
* Using sort-merge join for non-equi joins
* Reordering joins to reduce the number of rows being joined
* Using indexes on join columns
* Optimizing memory usage by reducing the amount of data being joined

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in Join Optimization Strategies include:
* Using nested loop joins for large tables
* Joining tables in the wrong order, resulting in a large number of rows being joined
* Failing to use indexes on join columns
* Not optimizing memory usage, resulting in excessive disk I/O
