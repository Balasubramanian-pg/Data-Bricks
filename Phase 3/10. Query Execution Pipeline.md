# 10. Query Execution Pipeline

Canonical documentation for 10. Query Execution Pipeline. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 10. Query Execution Pipeline exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The Query Execution Pipeline exists to optimize and streamline the process of executing queries on large datasets, addressing the class of problems related to data retrieval, processing, and analysis. It provides a structured approach to query execution, enabling efficient and scalable data processing.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The Query Execution Pipeline is a series of stages that a query goes through, from initial receipt to final result delivery. It involves parsing, optimization, execution, and result processing, with each stage building on the previous one to produce the final output.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Query | A request for data or information, typically expressed in a query language such as SQL. |
| Pipeline | A series of stages that process a query, transforming it from initial receipt to final result delivery. |
| Parser | A component that analyzes the query and breaks it down into its constituent parts. |
| Optimizer | A component that analyzes the query and determines the most efficient execution plan. |
| Executor | A component that executes the query, retrieving and processing the required data. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of the Query Execution Pipeline include:
* **Query Parsing**: breaking down the query into its constituent parts.
* **Query Optimization**: determining the most efficient execution plan for the query.
* **Query Execution**: retrieving and processing the required data.
* **Result Processing**: transforming the raw results into the final output.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for the Query Execution Pipeline involves the following stages:
1. **Query Receipt**: receiving the query from the client or application.
2. **Query Parsing**: parsing the query into its constituent parts.
3. **Query Optimization**: optimizing the query execution plan.
4. **Query Execution**: executing the query and retrieving the required data.
5. **Result Processing**: transforming the raw results into the final output.
6. **Result Delivery**: delivering the final results to the client or application.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in the Query Execution Pipeline include:
* **Query Caching**: caching frequently executed queries to improve performance.
* **Query Rewriting**: rewriting queries to optimize execution plans.
* **Data Partitioning**: partitioning large datasets to improve query performance.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in the Query Execution Pipeline include:
* **Over-Optimization**: over-optimizing queries, leading to increased complexity and decreased performance.
* **Under-Optimization**: under-optimizing queries, leading to decreased performance and increased resource utilization.
* **Inefficient Data Retrieval**: retrieving unnecessary data, leading to decreased performance and increased resource utilization.
