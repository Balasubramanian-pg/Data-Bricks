# 4. Executor Processes Deep Dive

Canonical documentation for 4. Executor Processes Deep Dive. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 4. Executor Processes Deep Dive exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The Executor Processes Deep Dive is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the executor process model, which addresses the need for efficient and scalable execution of tasks in concurrent and parallel systems. The primary problem space includes managing multiple tasks, threads, or processes, ensuring efficient resource utilization, and maintaining system stability.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The executor process model revolves around the concept of a centralized executor that manages a pool of worker threads or processes. These workers are responsible for executing tasks, which can be submitted by various components of the system. The executor acts as an intermediary, decoupling task submission from task execution, and providing a layer of abstraction for task management.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Executor | A component responsible for managing the execution of tasks. |
| Task | A unit of work that can be executed by a worker thread or process. |
| Worker | A thread or process that executes tasks submitted to the executor. |
| Thread Pool | A group of worker threads managed by the executor to execute tasks. |
| Process Pool | A group of worker processes managed by the executor to execute tasks. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of the executor process model include:
* **Task submission**: The process of submitting tasks to the executor for execution.
* **Task execution**: The process of executing tasks by worker threads or processes.
* **Thread or process management**: The process of managing the lifecycle of worker threads or processes.
* **Resource management**: The process of managing system resources, such as memory and CPU, to ensure efficient execution of tasks.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for executor processes involves the following components:
* **Executor**: The central component responsible for managing task execution.
* **Task queue**: A data structure that stores tasks submitted to the executor.
* **Worker threads or processes**: The components responsible for executing tasks.
* **Thread or process pool**: A group of worker threads or processes managed by the executor.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in executor process design include:
* **Thread pool pattern**: Using a pool of worker threads to execute tasks.
* **Process pool pattern**: Using a pool of worker processes to execute tasks.
* **Task queue pattern**: Using a queue to store tasks submitted to the executor.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in executor process design include:
* **Overloading the executor**: Submitting too many tasks to the executor, leading to performance degradation.
* **Underutilization of resources**: Failing to utilize system resources efficiently, leading to wasted resources.
* **Lack of error handling**: Failing to handle errors and exceptions properly, leading to system instability.
