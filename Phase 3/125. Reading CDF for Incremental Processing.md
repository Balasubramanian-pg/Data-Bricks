> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 125. Reading CDF for Incremental Processing exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The primary purpose of Reading CDF for Incremental Processing is to enable efficient and scalable data processing by allowing systems to read and process data in increments, rather than requiring a full reload of the data. This approach addresses the problem of handling large datasets, reducing processing time, and improving overall system performance. The class of problems it addresses includes data ingestion, data integration, and data processing in various industries such as finance, healthcare, and e-commerce.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of Reading CDF for Incremental Processing involves understanding the basics of CDF (Common Data Format) and incremental processing. CDF is a binary format used to store and transport data, while incremental processing refers to the ability to process data in small chunks, rather than in bulk. The high-level mental model consists of the following components: data sources, CDF files, incremental processing engine, and data targets. The data sources generate the data, which is then written to CDF files. The incremental processing engine reads the CDF files, processes the data in increments, and writes the output to data targets.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| CDF | Common Data Format, a binary format used to store and transport data |
| Incremental Processing | The ability to process data in small chunks, rather than in bulk |
| Data Source | The origin of the data, such as a database, file, or message queue |
| Data Target | The destination of the processed data, such as a database, file, or data warehouse |
| Incremental Processing Engine | A software component that reads CDF files, processes the data in increments, and writes the output to data targets |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Reading CDF for Incremental Processing include: 
1. **Incremental Processing**: The ability to process data in small chunks, rather than in bulk.
2. **CDF Files**: The binary format used to store and transport data.
3. **Data Sources and Targets**: The origin and destination of the data, respectively.
4. **Processing Engine**: The software component that reads CDF files, processes the data in increments, and writes the output to data targets.
5. **Scalability and Performance**: The ability of the system to handle large datasets and process data efficiently.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Reading CDF for Incremental Processing involves the following steps:
1. **Data Ingestion**: Data is generated by the data source and written to CDF files.
2. **Incremental Processing**: The incremental processing engine reads the CDF files, processes the data in increments, and writes the output to data targets.
3. **Data Integration**: The processed data is integrated with other data sources, if necessary.
4. **Data Storage**: The processed data is stored in a data target, such as a database or data warehouse.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for Reading CDF for Incremental Processing include:
1. **Micro-Batching**: Processing data in small batches, rather than in real-time.
2. **Streaming**: Processing data in real-time, as it is generated by the data source.
3. **Batch Processing**: Processing data in bulk, rather than in increments.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for Reading CDF for Incremental Processing include:
1. **Full Reload**: Reloading the entire dataset, rather than processing data in increments.
2. **Bulk Processing**: Processing data in bulk, rather than in increments.
3. **Inefficient Data Storage**: Storing data in an inefficient format, such as a text file, rather than a binary format like CDF.
