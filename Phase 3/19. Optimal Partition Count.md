Canonical documentation for 19. Optimal Partition Count. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 19. Optimal Partition Count exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The Optimal Partition Count exists to solve the problem of determining the ideal number of partitions for a given dataset or system, ensuring efficient data distribution, storage, and retrieval. This problem space is crucial in various domains, including database management, data warehousing, and big data analytics, where improper partitioning can lead to performance degradation, increased storage costs, and decreased data accessibility.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The Optimal Partition Count can be conceptualized as a balance between the number of partitions and the size of each partition, aiming to minimize overhead while maximizing efficiency. This balance is influenced by factors such as data volume, query patterns, storage capacity, and system resources. The optimal partition count is not a one-size-fits-all solution but rather a dynamic value that depends on the specific use case and system constraints.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Partition | A subset of data stored together, often based on a specific criteria such as range, list, or hash. |
| Partition Count | The number of partitions in a system or dataset. |
| Optimal Partition Count | The ideal number of partitions that balances efficiency, performance, and storage costs. |
| Data Distribution | The process of dividing data into partitions to ensure efficient storage and retrieval. |
| Partitioning Strategy | A method or approach used to determine the optimal partition count and partition boundaries. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Optimal Partition Count include:
* **Data partitioning**: dividing data into smaller, manageable chunks to improve storage and retrieval efficiency.
* **Partitioning strategies**: various methods, such as range-based, list-based, or hash-based partitioning, used to determine the optimal partition count and boundaries.
* **System constraints**: factors such as storage capacity, system resources, and query patterns that influence the optimal partition count.
* **Efficiency metrics**: measures such as query performance, storage costs, and data accessibility used to evaluate the effectiveness of the partitioning strategy.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Optimal Partition Count involves a combination of the following steps:
1. **Data analysis**: understanding the data distribution, query patterns, and system constraints.
2. **Partitioning strategy selection**: choosing a suitable partitioning strategy based on the data characteristics and system requirements.
3. **Partition count determination**: calculating the optimal partition count using metrics such as data volume, query frequency, and storage capacity.
4. **Partition boundary definition**: establishing the boundaries for each partition based on the chosen partitioning strategy.
5. **Monitoring and adjustment**: continuously monitoring the system performance and adjusting the partition count and boundaries as needed.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in Optimal Partition Count include:
* **Range-based partitioning**: dividing data into partitions based on a specific range of values.
* **List-based partitioning**: partitioning data based on a predefined list of values.
* **Hash-based partitioning**: using a hash function to distribute data across partitions.
* **Composite partitioning**: combining multiple partitioning strategies to achieve optimal results.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in Optimal Partition Count include:
* **Over-partitioning**: creating too many partitions, leading to increased overhead and decreased performance.
* **Under-partitioning**: using too few partitions, resulting in decreased efficiency and increased storage costs.
* **Inconsistent partitioning**: using different partitioning strategies for different datasets or systems, leading to complexity and maintenance issues.
