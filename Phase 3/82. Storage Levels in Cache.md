# 82. Storage Levels in Cache

Canonical documentation for 82. Storage Levels in Cache. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 82. Storage Levels in Cache exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of storage levels in cache is to provide a hierarchical structure for storing and retrieving data, addressing the problem of optimizing data access times and reducing the latency associated with main memory access. The class of problems it addresses includes improving system performance, reducing power consumption, and increasing overall efficiency.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual model of storage levels in cache involves a multi-level hierarchy, where each level represents a different storage location, such as register files, level 1 (L1) cache, level 2 (L2) cache, and main memory. Each level has a varying degree of proximity to the central processing unit (CPU), with closer levels providing faster access times.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Cache | A small, fast memory location that stores frequently accessed data |
| Cache Line | The smallest unit of data that can be transferred between cache levels |
| Cache Hit | When the requested data is found in the cache |
| Cache Miss | When the requested data is not found in the cache |
| Level 1 (L1) Cache | The smallest and fastest cache level, built into the CPU |
| Level 2 (L2) Cache | A larger and slower cache level, located outside the CPU |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of storage levels in cache include:
* Temporal locality: The tendency of a program to access data that was recently accessed
* Spatial locality: The tendency of a program to access data that is located near recently accessed data
* Cache replacement policies: Algorithms used to determine which cache line to replace when a new line is added

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for storage levels in cache involves a hierarchical structure with the following levels:
1. Register files
2. Level 1 (L1) cache
3. Level 2 (L2) cache
4. Main memory

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in storage levels in cache include:
* Using a smaller, faster cache level (L1) for frequently accessed data
* Using a larger, slower cache level (L2) for less frequently accessed data
* Implementing cache replacement policies, such as least recently used (LRU)

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in storage levels in cache include:
* Using a single, large cache level, which can lead to increased latency and power consumption
* Failing to implement cache replacement policies, which can lead to reduced cache performance
