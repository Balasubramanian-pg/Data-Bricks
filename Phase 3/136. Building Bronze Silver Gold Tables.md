> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 136. Building Bronze Silver Gold Tables exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of building Bronze Silver Gold tables is to provide a structured approach to data transformation and loading, addressing the challenges of managing complex data pipelines, ensuring data quality, and optimizing data processing. This approach helps solve problems related to data integration, data warehousing, and business intelligence, particularly in handling large volumes of data from various sources.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The Bronze Silver Gold table architecture is a hierarchical data transformation framework. It starts with raw, unprocessed data (Bronze), applies transformations and quality checks to create reliable, integrated data (Silver), and finally, aggregates and refines the data for analytics and reporting purposes (Gold). This layered approach facilitates data governance, improves data reliability, and supports scalable data analysis.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Bronze Table | The initial layer where raw, unprocessed data is stored, often directly ingested from source systems. |
| Silver Table | The intermediate layer where data is transformed, cleaned, and integrated, making it reliable for further processing. |
| Gold Table | The final layer where data is aggregated, refined, and prepared for analytics, reporting, and business intelligence. |
| Data Transformation | The process of converting data from one format to another to meet the requirements of the target system or application. |
| Data Quality | The measure of how well the data meets the requirements of the users and the organization, including aspects like accuracy, completeness, and consistency. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of building Bronze Silver Gold tables include data ingestion, transformation, quality control, and aggregation. Data ingestion involves collecting data from various sources into the Bronze layer. Transformation and quality control are applied in the Silver layer to ensure data reliability and consistency. Finally, data aggregation and refinement in the Gold layer prepare the data for consumption by end-users or applications.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Bronze Silver Gold tables involves a linear progression from Bronze to Silver to Gold, with each layer building upon the previous one. The Bronze layer is the source, the Silver layer applies transformations and ensures data quality, and the Gold layer prepares data for final consumption. This model is widely adopted due to its simplicity, scalability, and effectiveness in managing complex data workflows.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in building Bronze Silver Gold tables include using ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tools for data transformation, implementing data validation and quality checks in the Silver layer, and utilizing data aggregation and summarization techniques in the Gold layer. Additionally, patterns such as using version control for tracking changes and implementing data lineage for transparency are also prevalent.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in this context include skipping the Silver layer and directly transforming data from Bronze to Gold, which can lead to data quality issues and make debugging challenging. Another anti-pattern is overloading the Gold layer with complex transformations, which can impact performance and scalability. Ignoring data quality checks and validations is also a discouraged practice, as it can result in unreliable data being used for critical decisions.
