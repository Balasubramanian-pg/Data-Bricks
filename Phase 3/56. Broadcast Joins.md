# 56. Broadcast Joins

Canonical documentation for 56. Broadcast Joins. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 56. Broadcast Joins exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Broadcast Joins are designed to optimize the processing of large-scale data by reducing the amount of data that needs to be transferred and processed. This is particularly useful in distributed computing environments where data is split across multiple nodes. The primary problem that Broadcast Joins addresses is the need to perform joins on large datasets in a efficient and scalable manner.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
At its core, a Broadcast Join is a type of join operation where one side of the join is small enough to be broadcasted to all nodes in the cluster. This allows the join to be performed locally on each node, reducing the need for data transfer and improving performance. The broadcasted data is typically cached on each node, allowing for fast lookup and join operations.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Broadcast Join | A type of join operation where one side of the join is broadcasted to all nodes in the cluster. |
| Driver Node | The node responsible for coordinating the broadcast join operation. |
| Broadcast Data | The data that is broadcasted to all nodes in the cluster. |
| Local Join | The join operation performed on each node using the broadcast data. |
| Distributed Join | A join operation that is performed across multiple nodes in a cluster. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Broadcast Joins include:
* **Data partitioning**: The process of splitting data into smaller chunks that can be processed in parallel.
* **Data broadcasting**: The process of sending data to all nodes in a cluster.
* **Local processing**: The process of performing computations on data locally on each node.
* **Join operations**: The process of combining data from multiple sources based on a common key.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Broadcast Joins involves the following steps:
1. **Data preparation**: The data to be joined is prepared and partitioned into smaller chunks.
2. **Broadcasting**: The smaller side of the join is broadcasted to all nodes in the cluster.
3. **Local join**: Each node performs the join operation using the broadcast data and the local data.
4. **Result aggregation**: The results from each node are aggregated to produce the final result.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for Broadcast Joins include:
* **Using a driver node**: A driver node is used to coordinate the broadcast join operation and aggregate the results.
* **Caching broadcast data**: The broadcast data is cached on each node to improve performance.
* **Using a distributed file system**: A distributed file system is used to store and manage the data to be joined.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for Broadcast Joins include:
* **Broadcasting large datasets**: Broadcasting large datasets can lead to performance issues and network congestion.
* **Not caching broadcast data**: Not caching broadcast data can lead to repeated broadcasts and decreased performance.
* **Not optimizing join operations**: Not optimizing join operations can lead to decreased performance and increased resource usage.
