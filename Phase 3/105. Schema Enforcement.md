# 105. Schema Enforcement

Canonical documentation for 105. Schema Enforcement. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 105. Schema Enforcement exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The primary purpose of schema enforcement is to ensure data consistency and integrity by validating data against a predefined schema. This addresses the problem of data corruption, inconsistencies, and errors that can occur when data is not properly validated. Schema enforcement is crucial in various domains, including databases, data warehouses, and data lakes, where data quality and reliability are paramount.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Schema enforcement involves defining a set of rules, constraints, and relationships that govern the structure and content of data. This schema serves as a blueprint for data validation, ensuring that data conforms to the defined standards. The enforcement process typically involves parsing, validation, and error handling, which can be performed at various stages, including data ingestion, processing, and storage.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Schema | A set of rules, constraints, and relationships that define the structure and content of data. |
| Validation | The process of checking data against a schema to ensure conformity. |
| Enforcement | The act of applying schema constraints to ensure data integrity and consistency. |
| Data Integrity | The state of data being accurate, complete, and consistent. |
| Data Quality | The measure of data being fit for purpose, accurate, and reliable. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of schema enforcement include:
* **Schema definition**: The process of creating a schema that defines the structure and content of data.
* **Validation rules**: The set of rules and constraints that govern data validation.
* **Enforcement mechanisms**: The methods and techniques used to apply schema constraints and ensure data integrity.
* **Error handling**: The process of detecting, reporting, and resolving data validation errors.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for schema enforcement involves the following components:
* **Schema registry**: A centralized repository that stores and manages schema definitions.
* **Validation engine**: A component that performs data validation against the schema.
* **Error handling mechanism**: A process that detects, reports, and resolves data validation errors.
* **Data storage**: A repository that stores validated data.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in schema enforcement include:
* **Data validation at ingestion**: Validating data at the point of ingestion to prevent corrupted data from entering the system.
* **Data validation at processing**: Validating data during processing to ensure data integrity and consistency.
* **Data validation at storage**: Validating data at the point of storage to ensure data is properly formatted and consistent.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in schema enforcement include:
* **Lack of schema definition**: Failing to define a schema, leading to data inconsistencies and errors.
* **Inadequate validation**: Failing to perform thorough data validation, leading to data corruption and errors.
* **Inconsistent enforcement**: Applying schema constraints inconsistently, leading to data inconsistencies and errors.
