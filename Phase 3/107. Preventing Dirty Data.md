Canonical documentation for 107. Preventing Dirty Data. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 107. Preventing Dirty Data exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of preventing dirty data is to ensure the accuracy, completeness, and consistency of data throughout its lifecycle. Dirty data, also known as erroneous or invalid data, can have severe consequences, including incorrect insights, poor decision-making, and compromised data-driven applications. The problem space includes data entry errors, formatting inconsistencies, duplicates, and missing values, which can arise from various sources, such as user input, data migration, or system integration.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Preventing dirty data involves a proactive and multi-faceted approach that encompasses data validation, data cleansing, data normalization, and data quality monitoring. It requires a deep understanding of the data's structure, semantics, and business rules, as well as the implementation of robust data governance policies and procedures. The goal is to detect and prevent errors at the point of data entry or ingestion, ensuring that data is accurate, complete, and consistent across the organization.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Data Quality | The degree to which data is accurate, complete, consistent, and reliable. |
| Data Validation | The process of checking data against a set of rules or constraints to ensure its accuracy and consistency. |
| Data Cleansing | The process of identifying, correcting, or removing erroneous or invalid data. |
| Data Normalization | The process of transforming data into a standard format to ensure consistency and comparability. |
| Data Governance | The set of policies, procedures, and standards that ensure the effective management of data across the organization. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of preventing dirty data include:
* Data validation: checking data against business rules and constraints to ensure accuracy and consistency.
* Data profiling: analyzing data to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies.
* Data standardization: transforming data into a standard format to ensure consistency and comparability.
* Data monitoring: continuously tracking data quality and detecting errors or inconsistencies.
* Data correction: correcting or removing erroneous or invalid data.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for preventing dirty data involves a combination of preventive and detective measures, including:
* Data validation rules and constraints
* Data profiling and analysis
* Data standardization and normalization
* Data quality monitoring and reporting
* Data correction and cleansing procedures

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for preventing dirty data include:
* Using data validation rules and constraints to ensure data accuracy and consistency.
* Implementing data profiling and analysis to identify patterns and anomalies.
* Standardizing data formats and structures to ensure consistency and comparability.
* Establishing data quality monitoring and reporting processes to detect errors and inconsistencies.
* Developing data correction and cleansing procedures to address errors and inconsistencies.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for preventing dirty data include:
* Ignoring data quality issues or assuming they will resolve themselves.
* Failing to implement data validation rules and constraints.
* Not standardizing data formats and structures.
* Not monitoring data quality or detecting errors and inconsistencies.
* Not correcting or removing erroneous or invalid data.
