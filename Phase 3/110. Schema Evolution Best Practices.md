# 110. Schema Evolution Best Practices

Canonical documentation for 110. Schema Evolution Best Practices. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 110. Schema Evolution Best Practices exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of schema evolution best practices is to provide a set of guidelines and principles for managing changes to a database schema over time. This is necessary because schemas are not static and will inevitably need to be modified as the requirements of the application or system change. The class of problems that schema evolution best practices addresses includes ensuring data consistency, minimizing downtime, and reducing the risk of data loss or corruption during schema changes.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Schema evolution best practices involve a combination of planning, design, and execution activities. The process begins with an understanding of the current schema and the requirements for change. This is followed by the design of a new schema that meets the changed requirements, and the creation of a plan for migrating the existing data to the new schema. The plan must take into account the need to minimize downtime, ensure data consistency, and reduce the risk of data loss or corruption.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Schema | The overall structure or organization of a database, including the relationships between different data entities. |
| Schema Evolution | The process of making changes to a database schema over time. |
| Backward Compatibility | The ability of a new schema to support existing applications or systems without requiring changes to those applications or systems. |
| Forward Compatibility | The ability of an existing application or system to support a new schema without requiring changes to the application or system. |
| Data Migration | The process of transferring data from an existing schema to a new schema. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of schema evolution best practices include:
* **Backward compatibility**: Ensuring that a new schema is compatible with existing applications or systems.
* **Forward compatibility**: Ensuring that existing applications or systems can support a new schema.
* **Data migration**: Transferring data from an existing schema to a new schema.
* **Minimizing downtime**: Reducing the amount of time that a system or application is unavailable during schema changes.
* **Ensuring data consistency**: Ensuring that data remains consistent and accurate during schema changes.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for schema evolution involves the following steps:
1. **Plan**: Understand the current schema and the requirements for change.
2. **Design**: Design a new schema that meets the changed requirements.
3. **Implement**: Implement the new schema and migrate the existing data.
4. **Test**: Test the new schema and data migration to ensure that they are correct and complete.
5. **Deploy**: Deploy the new schema and data migration to production.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in schema evolution include:
* **Adding new columns**: Adding new columns to an existing table to support new requirements.
* **Renaming columns**: Renaming existing columns to better reflect their purpose or meaning.
* **Splitting tables**: Splitting a large table into smaller tables to improve performance or reduce complexity.
* **Merging tables**: Merging multiple tables into a single table to reduce complexity or improve performance.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in schema evolution include:
* **Making unnecessary changes**: Making changes to a schema that are not necessary or that do not provide any benefits.
* **Not testing changes**: Failing to test changes to a schema before deploying them to production.
* **Not documenting changes**: Failing to document changes to a schema, making it difficult to understand the purpose or meaning of the changes.
* **Making changes without a plan**: Making changes to a schema without a plan or strategy, leading to confusion or errors.
