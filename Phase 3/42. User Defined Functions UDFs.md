# 42. User Defined Functions UDFs

Canonical documentation for 42. User Defined Functions UDFs. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 42. User Defined Functions UDFs exists and the class of problems it addresses.
User Defined Functions (UDFs) exist to extend the functionality of a database management system, allowing users to create custom functions that can be used to perform complex operations, data transformations, and calculations. The primary problem space addressed by UDFs is the need for customized data processing and analysis capabilities that are not provided by the standard database functions.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
UDFs are reusable blocks of code that can be created, stored, and executed within a database management system. They can take input parameters, perform calculations and operations, and return output values. UDFs can be used to simplify complex queries, improve data consistency, and enhance data analysis capabilities.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| User Defined Function (UDF) | A custom function created by a user to perform a specific task or operation. |
| Database Management System (DBMS) | A software system that manages and stores data in a structured and controlled manner. |
| Parameter | A value passed to a UDF as input. |
| Return Value | The output value returned by a UDF. |
| SQL | Structured Query Language, a standard language for managing relational databases. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of UDFs include:
* **Modularity**: UDFs are self-contained blocks of code that can be created, modified, and reused independently.
* **Reusability**: UDFs can be used multiple times within a database, reducing code duplication and improving maintainability.
* **Flexibility**: UDFs can be used to perform a wide range of tasks, from simple calculations to complex data transformations.
* **Security**: UDFs can be used to encapsulate sensitive data and logic, improving data security and access control.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for UDFs involves creating a UDF as a separate entity within a database, using a programming language such as SQL or a proprietary language. The UDF is then stored in the database and can be called from SQL queries or other UDFs.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for UDFs include:
* **Data validation**: Using UDFs to validate data input and ensure data consistency.
* **Data transformation**: Using UDFs to perform complex data transformations, such as data aggregation or data normalization.
* **Business logic**: Using UDFs to encapsulate business logic and rules, improving data integrity and reducing errors.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for UDFs include:
* **Overuse**: Creating too many UDFs, leading to code duplication and maintainability issues.
* **Tight coupling**: Creating UDFs that are tightly coupled to specific database tables or structures, reducing flexibility and reusability.
* **Inefficient coding**: Writing inefficient or poorly optimized UDFs, leading to performance issues and scalability problems.
