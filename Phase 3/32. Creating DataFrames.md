# 32. Creating DataFrames

Canonical documentation for 32. Creating DataFrames. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 32. Creating DataFrames exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of creating DataFrames is to provide a flexible and efficient data structure for storing and manipulating tabular data. The problem space addressed by DataFrames includes data manipulation, analysis, and visualization, particularly in the context of data science and scientific computing. DataFrames are designed to handle large datasets and provide an intuitive interface for data transformation, filtering, and aggregation.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
A DataFrame is a two-dimensional table of data with rows and columns, similar to an Excel spreadsheet or a table in a relational database. Each column in the DataFrame represents a variable or field, while each row represents a single observation or record. DataFrames can be created from various data sources, such as CSV files, databases, or other data structures.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| DataFrame | A two-dimensional table of data with rows and columns. |
| Index | A column or set of columns that uniquely identify each row in the DataFrame. |
| Column | A vertical array of values in the DataFrame, representing a variable or field. |
| Row | A horizontal array of values in the DataFrame, representing a single observation or record. |
| Data Type | The type of data stored in a column, such as integer, string, or datetime. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of creating DataFrames include:
* Data structures: DataFrames are built on top of underlying data structures, such as arrays or lists.
* Data types: DataFrames support various data types, including numeric, string, and datetime types.
* Indexing: DataFrames use indexing to uniquely identify each row and column.
* Data manipulation: DataFrames provide various methods for data manipulation, such as filtering, sorting, and grouping.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for creating DataFrames involves the following steps:
1. Importing the necessary library or module.
2. Loading the data from a file or other data source.
3. Creating the DataFrame using the loaded data.
4. Verifying the structure and content of the DataFrame.
5. Performing data manipulation and analysis tasks as needed.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for creating DataFrames include:
* Using the `read_csv` function to load data from a CSV file.
* Using the `DataFrame` constructor to create a DataFrame from a dictionary or list of lists.
* Using the `merge` function to combine DataFrames based on a common column.
* Using the `groupby` function to perform aggregation and grouping operations.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for creating DataFrames include:
* Using DataFrames to store large amounts of unstructured data.
* Using DataFrames as a replacement for databases or other specialized data storage systems.
* Failing to verify the structure and content of the DataFrame after creation.
* Using DataFrames without proper indexing or data typing.
