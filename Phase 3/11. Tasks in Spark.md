# 11. Tasks in Spark

Canonical documentation for 11. Tasks in Spark. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 11. Tasks in Spark exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Tasks in Spark exist to provide a scalable and efficient way to process large datasets across a cluster of computers. The class of problems it addresses includes data processing, data analytics, and machine learning. Spark tasks are designed to handle massive amounts of data and provide high-performance processing capabilities, making it an ideal solution for big data processing.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of tasks in Spark involves understanding how Spark breaks down a job into smaller, independent tasks that can be executed in parallel across a cluster of nodes. Each task represents a unit of work that can be executed independently, and the output of each task is combined to produce the final result. This parallel processing model allows Spark to scale horizontally and process large datasets efficiently.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Task | A unit of work that can be executed independently in a Spark job |
| Job | A collection of tasks that are executed together to achieve a common goal |
| Stage | A group of tasks that are executed together in a single thread |
| Executor | A process that runs on a node in the cluster and executes tasks |
| Driver | The process that coordinates the execution of tasks and manages the job lifecycle |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of tasks in Spark include:
* **Task creation**: Spark breaks down a job into smaller tasks based on the input data and the processing requirements.
* **Task scheduling**: Spark schedules tasks for execution on available executors in the cluster.
* **Task execution**: Each task is executed independently on an executor, and the output is stored in memory or written to disk.
* **Task aggregation**: The output of each task is combined to produce the final result.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for tasks in Spark involves the following steps:
1. **Job submission**: A job is submitted to the Spark driver, which breaks down the job into smaller tasks.
2. **Task creation**: The driver creates tasks based on the input data and processing requirements.
3. **Task scheduling**: The driver schedules tasks for execution on available executors.
4. **Task execution**: Each task is executed independently on an executor.
5. **Task aggregation**: The output of each task is combined to produce the final result.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for tasks in Spark include:
* **MapReduce**: A pattern that involves mapping input data to a new format and then reducing the output to produce a final result.
* **Data aggregation**: A pattern that involves aggregating data from multiple sources to produce a single output.
* **Data transformation**: A pattern that involves transforming input data into a new format or structure.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for tasks in Spark include:
* **Over-partitioning**: Creating too many small tasks that can lead to overhead and decreased performance.
* **Under-partitioning**: Creating too few large tasks that can lead to decreased parallelism and performance.
* **Unbalanced tasks**: Creating tasks that have significantly different execution times, leading to decreased overall performance.
