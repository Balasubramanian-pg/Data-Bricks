# 116. UPDATE Operations in Delta

Canonical documentation for 116. UPDATE Operations in Delta. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 116. UPDATE Operations in Delta exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The 116. UPDATE Operations in Delta specification exists to provide a standardized approach to updating data in Delta tables, addressing the need for efficient, reliable, and scalable data modification operations. This specification targets the class of problems related to data updates, including data inconsistencies, performance issues, and data integrity concerns.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The UPDATE Operations in Delta specification is based on a simple, yet powerful concept: updating data in a Delta table by merging new data with existing data. This process involves matching the new data with the existing data, applying the updates, and producing a new version of the data. The specification provides a set of rules, guidelines, and best practices for implementing this concept in a variety of scenarios.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Delta Table | A table that stores data in a Delta-encoded format, allowing for efficient updates and queries. |
| Update Operation | An operation that modifies existing data in a Delta table, such as inserting, updating, or deleting rows. |
| Merge Operation | An operation that combines new data with existing data in a Delta table, producing a new version of the data. |
| Match Condition | A condition that determines which rows in the existing data are updated by the new data. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of the UPDATE Operations in Delta specification include:
* **Delta encoding**: a format for storing data that allows for efficient updates and queries.
* **Merge operations**: combining new data with existing data to produce a new version of the data.
* **Match conditions**: determining which rows in the existing data are updated by the new data.
* **Update rules**: guidelines for applying updates to the existing data.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for UPDATE Operations in Delta involves the following steps:
1. Prepare the new data for update.
2. Match the new data with the existing data using a match condition.
3. Apply the updates to the existing data.
4. Produce a new version of the data.
5. Validate the updated data.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for UPDATE Operations in Delta include:
* **Periodic updates**: updating data at regular intervals, such as daily or weekly.
* **Event-driven updates**: updating data in response to specific events, such as user interactions.
* **Batch updates**: updating data in batches, such as updating multiple rows at once.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for UPDATE Operations in Delta include:
* **Updating data without validation**: updating data without checking for errors or inconsistencies.
* **Using incorrect match conditions**: using match conditions that do not accurately identify the rows to be updated.
* **Not handling errors**: failing to handle errors that occur during the update process.
