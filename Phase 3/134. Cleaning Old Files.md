Canonical documentation for 134. Cleaning Old Files. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 134. Cleaning Old Files exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of cleaning old files is to remove unused, redundant, or obsolete data to free up storage space, reduce clutter, and improve overall system performance. The problem space includes issues such as data accumulation, storage capacity limitations, and decreased system efficiency due to outdated files.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Cleaning old files involves identifying and removing unnecessary files, updating existing files to reflect current information, and organizing remaining files in a logical and accessible manner. This process requires a thorough understanding of the file system, data types, and user needs.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Archiving | The process of moving older files to a separate storage location for long-term preservation. |
| Data Purge | The act of permanently deleting unnecessary or redundant files. |
| File System | A hierarchical structure used to organize and store files on a computer. |
| Metadata | Information about a file, such as its name, size, and creation date. |
| Storage Capacity | The maximum amount of data that can be stored on a device or system. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of cleaning old files include:
* Identifying unnecessary files through analysis of file metadata and usage patterns
* Developing a classification system to categorize files based on their importance and relevance
* Implementing a data retention policy to determine which files to keep and for how long
* Using automated tools and scripts to streamline the file cleaning process

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for cleaning old files involves a cyclical process of:
1. File identification and classification
2. Data analysis and filtering
3. File deletion or archiving
4. System maintenance and optimization
5. Monitoring and review to ensure the process is effective and efficient

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in cleaning old files include:
* Scheduling regular file cleaning tasks to maintain system performance
* Using automated tools to identify and delete duplicate or redundant files
* Implementing a version control system to track changes to files and reduce storage needs
* Creating a backup system to ensure data recovery in case of accidental deletion

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in cleaning old files include:
* Deleting files without proper backup or verification
* Failing to establish a data retention policy
* Ignoring system performance issues due to file accumulation
* Using manual methods to clean files, which can be time-consuming and prone to error
