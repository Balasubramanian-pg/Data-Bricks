> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 127. Table Maintenance Commands exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of 127. Table Maintenance Commands is to provide a standardized set of commands for maintaining and managing database tables. This includes creating, modifying, and deleting tables, as well as managing table data, indexes, and constraints. The class of problems it addresses includes data consistency, data integrity, and data scalability.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of 127. Table Maintenance Commands involves understanding the different types of commands, including Data Definition Language (DDL) commands, Data Manipulation Language (DML) commands, and Data Control Language (DCL) commands. It also involves understanding the different components of a database table, including rows, columns, indexes, and constraints.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Table | A collection of related data stored in a database |
| Row | A single entry in a table, consisting of a set of values |
| Column | A single field or attribute in a table |
| Index | A data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval |
| Constraint | A rule that is applied to a table to ensure data consistency and integrity |
| DDL | Data Definition Language, used to create, modify, and delete database objects |
| DML | Data Manipulation Language, used to insert, update, and delete data |
| DCL | Data Control Language, used to control access to database objects |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of 127. Table Maintenance Commands include understanding the different types of commands, including CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE, and COMMENT. It also involves understanding the different components of a database table, including rows, columns, indexes, and constraints. Additionally, it involves understanding the concepts of data consistency, data integrity, and data scalability.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for 127. Table Maintenance Commands involves using a combination of DDL, DML, and DCL commands to manage and maintain database tables. This includes creating tables with the CREATE command, modifying tables with the ALTER command, and deleting tables with the DROP command. It also involves using indexes and constraints to ensure data consistency and integrity.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for 127. Table Maintenance Commands include using the CREATE command to create a new table, using the ALTER command to add or modify columns, and using the DROP command to delete a table. It also involves using indexes to improve data retrieval speed and using constraints to ensure data consistency and integrity.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for 127. Table Maintenance Commands include using the DROP command to delete a table without backing up the data, using the ALTER command to modify a table without testing the changes, and using indexes and constraints without understanding their impact on performance.
