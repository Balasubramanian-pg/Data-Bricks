# 87. Delta Lake Storage Format

Canonical documentation for 87. Delta Lake Storage Format. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 87. Delta Lake Storage Format exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The Delta Lake Storage Format is designed to address the limitations of traditional data storage formats, particularly in the context of big data and data lakes. It provides a scalable, reliable, and performant storage solution for large-scale data processing and analytics workloads. The primary problems it addresses include data consistency, reliability, and performance issues associated with traditional storage formats.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The Delta Lake Storage Format is a columnar storage format that combines the benefits of row-based and column-based storage. It is optimized for fast query performance, high data compression, and efficient data processing. The format is based on a combination of Parquet and JSON files, which provide a flexible and extensible storage solution.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Delta Lake | An open-source storage format that provides a scalable and reliable solution for big data and data lakes. |
| Columnar Storage | A storage format that stores data in columns instead of rows, providing faster query performance and better data compression. |
| Parquet File | A binary file format that stores data in a columnar format, providing efficient storage and query performance. |
| JSON File | A text file format that stores metadata and other information about the data, providing flexibility and extensibility. |
| Data Lake | A centralized repository that stores raw, unprocessed data in its native format, providing a single source of truth for data analytics and processing. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of the Delta Lake Storage Format include:
* **Columnar storage**: storing data in columns instead of rows to improve query performance and data compression.
* **Parquet files**: using Parquet files to store data in a columnar format, providing efficient storage and query performance.
* **JSON files**: using JSON files to store metadata and other information about the data, providing flexibility and extensibility.
* **Data versioning**: providing a versioning mechanism to track changes to the data, ensuring data consistency and reliability.
* **ACID transactions**: supporting atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID) transactions to ensure data consistency and reliability.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for the Delta Lake Storage Format includes:
* **Data ingestion**: ingesting data into the Delta Lake Storage Format using tools such as Apache Spark, Apache Kafka, or Apache Flume.
* **Data processing**: processing data using tools such as Apache Spark, Apache Flink, or Apache Beam.
* **Data storage**: storing data in the Delta Lake Storage Format, using Parquet and JSON files.
* **Data query**: querying data using tools such as Apache Spark, Apache Hive, or Apache Impala.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for the Delta Lake Storage Format include:
* **Data warehousing**: using the Delta Lake Storage Format as a data warehouse, providing a centralized repository for data analytics and processing.
* **Data lakes**: using the Delta Lake Storage Format as a data lake, providing a centralized repository for raw, unprocessed data.
* **Real-time data processing**: using the Delta Lake Storage Format for real-time data processing, providing fast and efficient data processing and analytics.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for the Delta Lake Storage Format include:
* **Using row-based storage**: using row-based storage instead of columnar storage, which can lead to slower query performance and poorer data compression.
* **Not using data versioning**: not using data versioning, which can lead to data inconsistencies and reliability issues.
* **Not using ACID transactions**: not using ACID transactions, which can lead to data inconsistencies and reliability issues.
