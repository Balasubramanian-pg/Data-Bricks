Canonical documentation for 90. ACID Guarantees in Delta Lake. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 90. ACID Guarantees in Delta Lake exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The primary purpose of ACID guarantees in Delta Lake is to ensure the reliability and consistency of data transactions in a distributed environment. ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability, which are essential properties for maintaining data integrity. The class of problems that ACID guarantees in Delta Lake addresses includes data inconsistencies, errors, and inconsistencies that can occur during concurrent transactions, especially in big data and analytics workloads.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of ACID guarantees in Delta Lake involves a transactional framework that ensures all changes to the data are processed as a single, all-or-nothing unit of work. This framework provides a high-level mental model for understanding how Delta Lake manages concurrent transactions, handles failures, and maintains data consistency.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Atomicity | The property that ensures all operations within a transaction are treated as a single, indivisible unit of work. |
| Consistency | The property that ensures the data remains in a consistent state, even after multiple transactions have been applied. |
| Isolation | The property that ensures concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other. |
| Durability | The property that ensures once a transaction has been committed, its effects are permanent and survive even in the event of failures. |
| Transaction | A sequence of operations performed as a single, all-or-nothing unit of work. |
| Commit | The process of making a transaction's changes permanent. |
| Rollback | The process of undoing a transaction's changes. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of ACID guarantees in Delta Lake include:
* **Atomicity**: Ensuring that all operations within a transaction are treated as a single unit of work.
* **Consistency**: Ensuring that the data remains in a consistent state, even after multiple transactions have been applied.
* **Isolation**: Ensuring that concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other.
* **Durability**: Ensuring that once a transaction has been committed, its effects are permanent and survive even in the event of failures.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for ACID guarantees in Delta Lake involves a multi-step process:
1. **Begin Transaction**: Start a new transaction.
2. **Perform Operations**: Execute a series of operations within the transaction.
3. **Validate**: Verify that the transaction's changes are valid and consistent.
4. **Commit or Rollback**: Commit the transaction to make its changes permanent or roll back the transaction to undo its changes.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for ACID guarantees in Delta Lake include:
* **Batch Processing**: Processing large batches of data as a single transaction to ensure atomicity and consistency.
* **Real-time Processing**: Processing real-time data streams as a series of small transactions to ensure low-latency and high-throughput.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for ACID guarantees in Delta Lake include:
* **Long-Running Transactions**: Allowing transactions to run for extended periods, which can lead to concurrency issues and decreased performance.
* **Unnecessary Locking**: Acquiring unnecessary locks, which can lead to decreased concurrency and increased contention.
