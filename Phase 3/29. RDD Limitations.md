> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 29. RDD Limitations exists and the class of problems it addresses.
RDD Limitations exist to address the constraints and drawbacks of Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs) in big data processing. The primary problem space revolves around the limitations of RDDs in terms of performance, scalability, and functionality, which can hinder the efficient processing of large datasets. These limitations can lead to increased processing times, higher resource utilization, and decreased overall system performance.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
RDD Limitations can be conceptualized as a set of constraints that bound the capabilities of RDDs in distributed computing environments. These limitations can be broadly categorized into performance, scalability, and functional limitations. Understanding these limitations is crucial for designing and optimizing big data processing workflows that utilize RDDs.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| RDD | Resilient Distributed Dataset, a fundamental data structure in Apache Spark |
| Data Partitioning | The process of dividing data into smaller, manageable chunks for parallel processing |
| Cache Locality | The phenomenon where data is stored in memory close to the processing unit to reduce access latency |
| Shuffle | The process of redistributing data across nodes in a cluster to facilitate parallel processing |
| Serialization | The process of converting data into a format that can be written to a file or sent over a network |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts underlying RDD Limitations include:
* **Data serialization and deserialization overhead**: The process of converting data into a serialized format for storage or transmission can be computationally expensive.
* **Network overhead**: The transfer of data between nodes in a cluster can lead to significant network overhead, impacting performance.
* **Cache locality**: The proximity of data to the processing unit can significantly impact performance, with cache-friendly data access patterns leading to better performance.
* **Data partitioning and shuffle**: The way data is partitioned and shuffled across nodes can significantly impact the performance and scalability of RDD-based workflows.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for addressing RDD Limitations involves a combination of techniques, including:
* **Optimizing data serialization and deserialization**: Using efficient serialization formats and minimizing serialization overhead.
* **Improving cache locality**: Optimizing data access patterns to minimize cache misses and maximize cache locality.
* **Efficient data partitioning and shuffle**: Using techniques such as data partitioning, bucketing, and caching to minimize shuffle overhead.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for addressing RDD Limitations include:
* **Using efficient data structures**: Selecting data structures that minimize serialization overhead and optimize cache locality.
* **Optimizing data access patterns**: Designing data access patterns that minimize cache misses and maximize cache locality.
* **Leveraging caching and buffering**: Using caching and buffering techniques to reduce the overhead of data access and processing.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for addressing RDD Limitations include:
* **Using inefficient data structures**: Selecting data structures that lead to high serialization overhead and poor cache locality.
* **Ignoring data access patterns**: Failing to optimize data access patterns, leading to poor cache locality and increased processing times.
* **Over-reliance on shuffle**: Overusing shuffle operations, leading to increased network overhead and decreased performance.
