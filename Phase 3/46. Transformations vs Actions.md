# 46. Transformations vs Actions

Canonical documentation for 46. Transformations vs Actions. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 46. Transformations vs Actions exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The primary purpose of understanding the distinction between transformations and actions is to clarify the design and implementation of systems, particularly in the context of data processing, software development, and workflow management. This distinction addresses the class of problems related to changing or manipulating data, objects, or states within a system, ensuring that such changes are properly categorized, executed, and managed.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
At a high level, transformations refer to the process of changing data, objects, or states from one form to another, often involving a rules-based or algorithmic approach. Actions, on the other hand, are discrete steps or operations performed within a system, which may or may not involve transformations. This mental model helps in understanding how data flows through a system, how it is modified, and what triggers these modifications.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Transformation | A process or operation that changes data, objects, or states from one form to another, often following predefined rules or algorithms. |
| Action | A discrete step or operation performed within a system, which can include but is not limited to transformations. |
| State Change | An alteration in the status or condition of an object or data within a system, resulting from an action or transformation. |
| Workflow | A series of actions or transformations arranged in a specific order to achieve a particular goal or outcome. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts revolve around understanding the nature of transformations and actions, including their triggers, inputs, processing, outputs, and the resulting state changes. It's crucial to differentiate between these concepts to design efficient, scalable, and maintainable systems. Additionally, recognizing the sequence and dependency of actions and transformations within workflows is essential for managing complexity and ensuring system reliability.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for managing transformations and actions involves a structured approach:
1. **Definition**: Clearly define what constitutes a transformation versus an action within the context of the system.
2. **Categorization**: Categorize each process or operation as either a transformation or an action based on its characteristics and effects.
3. **Sequence Planning**: Plan the sequence of actions and transformations to achieve desired outcomes, considering dependencies and potential state changes.
4. **Execution**: Execute the planned sequence, monitoring for any deviations or errors.
5. **Review and Adjustment**: Regularly review the outcomes of actions and transformations, adjusting the model as necessary to improve efficiency, accuracy, or adaptability.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns include:
- **Batch Processing**: Applying transformations to large datasets in batches to improve efficiency.
- **Real-time Processing**: Performing actions or transformations as data becomes available, often in response to user interactions or event triggers.
- **Workflow Automation**: Automating sequences of actions and transformations to streamline business processes or system operations.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns to avoid include:
- **Over-Complexification**: Unnecessarily complicating workflows by overly segmenting actions or transformations, leading to maintainability issues.
- **Lack of Standardization**: Failing to establish clear distinctions between transformations and actions, resulting in confusion and inconsistencies.
- **Insufficient Testing**: Not thoroughly testing the outcomes of transformations and actions, potentially leading to errors or unexpected behavior.
