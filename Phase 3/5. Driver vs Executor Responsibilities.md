# 5. Driver vs Executor Responsibilities

Canonical documentation for 5. Driver vs Executor Responsibilities. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 5. Driver vs Executor Responsibilities exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The Driver vs Executor Responsibilities paradigm exists to delineate the roles and responsibilities within distributed computing systems, particularly in the context of big data processing and machine learning. This distinction is crucial for efficient resource utilization, scalability, and fault tolerance. The class of problems it addresses includes task management, resource allocation, and job scheduling in complex computing environments.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
At a high level, the Driver vs Executor Responsibilities model involves two primary components: the Driver and the Executor. The Driver is responsible for managing the lifecycle of a job or application, including task submission, monitoring, and result collection. The Executor, on the other hand, is responsible for executing the tasks assigned by the Driver. This separation of concerns enables efficient parallel processing, improved resource utilization, and enhanced system reliability.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Driver | The component responsible for managing the lifecycle of a job or application, including task submission, monitoring, and result collection. |
| Executor | The component responsible for executing the tasks assigned by the Driver. |
| Task | A unit of work that is executed by an Executor. |
| Job | A collection of tasks that are managed by a Driver. |
| Cluster | A group of nodes that work together to provide a shared resource, such as computing power or storage. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of the Driver vs Executor Responsibilities model include:
* **Task Management**: The process of submitting, monitoring, and managing tasks within a job.
* **Resource Allocation**: The process of assigning resources, such as computing power or memory, to tasks and jobs.
* **Job Scheduling**: The process of scheduling jobs and tasks for execution on a cluster.
* **Fault Tolerance**: The ability of a system to continue operating even if one or more components fail.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Driver vs Executor Responsibilities involves a centralized Driver that manages a pool of distributed Executors. The Driver is responsible for task submission, monitoring, and result collection, while the Executors are responsible for task execution. This model is widely used in distributed computing systems, including Apache Spark and Hadoop.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in the Driver vs Executor Responsibilities model include:
* **Master-Slave Architecture**: A pattern in which a centralized Driver (master) manages a pool of distributed Executors (slaves).
* **Peer-to-Peer Architecture**: A pattern in which multiple Drivers and Executors communicate directly with each other.
* **Data-Parallel Processing**: A pattern in which data is split into smaller chunks and processed in parallel by multiple Executors.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in the Driver vs Executor Responsibilities model include:
* **Tight Coupling**: A pattern in which the Driver and Executor are tightly coupled, making it difficult to modify or replace either component.
* **Resource Underutilization**: A pattern in which resources are underutilized due to inefficient task scheduling or resource allocation.
* **Lack of Fault Tolerance**: A pattern in which the system is not designed to handle failures or errors, leading to system downtime or data loss.
