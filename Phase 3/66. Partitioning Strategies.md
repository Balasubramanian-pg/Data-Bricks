Canonical documentation for 66. Partitioning Strategies. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 66. Partitioning Strategies exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The primary purpose of partitioning strategies is to divide large datasets or systems into smaller, more manageable parts, enhancing scalability, performance, and maintainability. This approach addresses the challenges of handling big data, improving query efficiency, and reducing storage costs. By partitioning data, organizations can optimize their systems for better data retrieval, processing, and analysis.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Partitioning strategies involve dividing data into smaller, independent segments based on predefined criteria, such as range, list, hash, or composite keys. This division enables efficient data retrieval, storage, and processing, as each partition can be managed and optimized separately. The conceptual model of partitioning strategies includes the identification of partitioning keys, the definition of partition boundaries, and the allocation of partitions to storage devices or nodes.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Partition | A subset of data that is stored and managed independently |
| Partition Key | A column or set of columns used to determine the partition for each row |
| Partition Boundary | The criteria used to divide data into partitions, such as a range of values |
| Shard | A subset of data that is stored on a separate node or device |
| Horizontal Partitioning | Dividing data into partitions based on rows |
| Vertical Partitioning | Dividing data into partitions based on columns |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of partitioning strategies include:
* **Data Division**: Dividing data into smaller, independent partitions to improve manageability and scalability.
* **Partitioning Criteria**: Defining the criteria used to divide data into partitions, such as range, list, or hash keys.
* **Partition Management**: Managing and optimizing each partition separately to improve performance and efficiency.
* **Data Retrieval**: Optimizing data retrieval by directing queries to the relevant partition.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for partitioning strategies involves the following steps:
1. **Identify Partitioning Keys**: Select the columns or set of columns that will be used to determine the partition for each row.
2. **Define Partition Boundaries**: Establish the criteria used to divide data into partitions, such as a range of values.
3. **Allocate Partitions**: Assign each partition to a storage device or node.
4. **Optimize Partitions**: Monitor and optimize each partition separately to improve performance and efficiency.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in partitioning strategies include:
* **Range-Based Partitioning**: Dividing data into partitions based on a range of values, such as date or integer ranges.
* **List-Based Partitioning**: Dividing data into partitions based on a list of values, such as a list of countries or regions.
* **Hash-Based Partitioning**: Dividing data into partitions based on a hash function, such as a modulo operation.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in partitioning strategies include:
* **Over-Partitioning**: Creating too many partitions, leading to increased complexity and decreased performance.
* **Under-Partitioning**: Creating too few partitions, leading to decreased scalability and performance.
* **Inconsistent Partitioning**: Using inconsistent partitioning criteria, leading to confusion and decreased data retrieval efficiency.
