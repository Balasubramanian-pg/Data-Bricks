# 84. Reading Query Plans

Canonical documentation for 84. Reading Query Plans. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 84. Reading Query Plans exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of reading query plans is to understand and optimize the performance of database queries. Query plans are the sequence of operations that a database management system (DBMS) uses to execute a query. By analyzing query plans, developers and database administrators can identify performance bottlenecks, optimize queries, and improve the overall efficiency of their database systems. The class of problems that reading query plans addresses includes query performance issues, database optimization, and troubleshooting.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of reading query plans involves understanding the query execution process, including parsing, optimization, and execution. The query execution process can be broken down into several stages, including query parsing, query optimization, and query execution. Query plans are generated during the optimization stage and provide a detailed outline of the operations that will be performed to execute the query.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Query Plan | A detailed outline of the operations that will be performed to execute a query |
| Execution Plan | A query plan that has been optimized for execution |
| Query Optimization | The process of selecting the most efficient query plan for a given query |
| Index | A data structure that improves query performance by providing a quick way to locate data |
| Join | A operation that combines data from two or more tables |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of reading query plans include understanding the different types of query plans, such as execution plans and query optimization plans. It also involves understanding the various operations that are performed during query execution, such as indexing, joining, and sorting. Additionally, it is essential to understand the different factors that affect query performance, such as data distribution, indexing, and system resources.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for reading query plans involves using a combination of visual and textual tools to analyze query plans. Visual tools, such as query plan diagrams, provide a graphical representation of the query plan, while textual tools, such as query plan text, provide a detailed outline of the operations that will be performed. The standard model also involves using a systematic approach to analyze query plans, including identifying the most expensive operations, analyzing data distribution, and optimizing indexing.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for reading query plans include using query plan analysis tools, such as SQL Server Management Studio or Oracle Enterprise Manager, to visualize and analyze query plans. Another common pattern is to use query optimization techniques, such as indexing and caching, to improve query performance. Additionally, it is common to use query plan metrics, such as execution time and CPU usage, to identify performance bottlenecks.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Common anti-patterns for reading query plans include relying solely on visual tools to analyze query plans, without considering the underlying query optimization process. Another anti-pattern is to focus solely on optimizing individual queries, without considering the overall system performance. Additionally, it is discouraged to use query plan analysis as a one-time task, rather than an ongoing process to monitor and optimize query performance.
