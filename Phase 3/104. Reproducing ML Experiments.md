## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 104. Reproducing ML Experiments exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Reproducing ML experiments is crucial for ensuring the reliability, validity, and generalizability of machine learning (ML) research. The primary purpose of reproducing ML experiments is to verify that the results obtained by one researcher or team can be independently replicated by others, thereby increasing confidence in the findings and facilitating the accumulation of knowledge in the field. The class of problems addressed by reproducing ML experiments includes issues related to experimental design, data quality, model implementation, and hyperparameter tuning, which can all impact the reproducibility of ML research.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of reproducing ML experiments involves understanding the key components and stages involved in the process. These include: (1) experimental design, which encompasses the definition of the research question, data collection, and experimental protocol; (2) data preparation, which includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and data splitting; (3) model implementation, which involves the selection and configuration of ML algorithms and hyperparameters; and (4) result analysis and interpretation, which includes the evaluation of model performance, identification of potential biases, and drawing of conclusions.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Reproducibility | The ability of an entire experiment or study to be duplicated, either by the same researcher or by someone else working independently. |
| Replicability | The ability of a result to be duplicated, either by the same researcher or by someone else working independently, but not necessarily the entire experiment. |
| Experimental Design | The process of planning and structuring an experiment to test a hypothesis or research question. |
| Hyperparameter Tuning | The process of selecting the optimal hyperparameters for an ML algorithm to achieve the best performance on a given task. |
| Model Implementation | The process of selecting, configuring, and training an ML algorithm to solve a specific problem. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of reproducing ML experiments include: (1) transparency, which involves providing detailed documentation of the experimental design, data, and model implementation; (2) accessibility, which involves making the data, code, and other resources used in the experiment available to others; (3) rigor, which involves ensuring that the experiment is designed and conducted to minimize bias and error; and (4) verifiability, which involves allowing others to verify the results by reproducing the experiment.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for reproducing ML experiments involves the following steps: (1) literature review and problem definition; (2) data collection and preprocessing; (3) experimental design and model implementation; (4) hyperparameter tuning and model training; (5) result analysis and interpretation; and (6) documentation and sharing of results. This model emphasizes the importance of transparency, accessibility, and rigor in the experimental design and conduct.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in reproducing ML experiments include: (1) using open-source libraries and frameworks to implement ML algorithms; (2) utilizing cloud-based platforms for data storage and computation; (3) employing automated hyperparameter tuning techniques; (4) using cross-validation to evaluate model performance; and (5) providing detailed documentation of the experimental design, data, and model implementation.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in reproducing ML experiments include: (1) failing to provide detailed documentation of the experimental design and model implementation; (2) using proprietary or closed-source software that limits accessibility; (3) neglecting to consider potential biases and errors in the data and model; (4) using inadequate or insufficient data for training and testing; and (5) failing to make the data and code used in the experiment available to others.
