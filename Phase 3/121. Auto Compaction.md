> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 121. Auto Compaction exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The primary purpose of 121. Auto Compaction is to automatically reclaim unused space in databases, file systems, or other storage systems, thereby improving storage efficiency, reducing fragmentation, and enhancing overall system performance. This feature addresses the problems of manual compaction, which can be time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to human error. By automating the compaction process, 121. Auto Compaction helps to ensure that storage systems operate at optimal levels, reducing the need for manual intervention and minimizing the risk of data corruption or loss.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
At its core, 121. Auto Compaction is a background process that periodically scans storage systems for unused or fragmented space, and then reclaims or reorganizes that space to improve storage efficiency. This process involves a series of complex algorithms and heuristics that analyze storage usage patterns, identify areas of inefficiency, and apply compaction techniques to optimize storage capacity. The conceptual overview of 121. Auto Compaction involves understanding the interactions between storage systems, compaction algorithms, and system performance metrics.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Auto Compaction | The automatic process of reclaiming unused space in storage systems to improve storage efficiency. |
| Fragmentation | The state of a storage system where free space is broken into small, non-contiguous blocks, reducing storage efficiency. |
| Compaction Algorithm | A set of rules or procedures used to analyze storage usage patterns and apply compaction techniques to optimize storage capacity. |
| Storage Efficiency | The ratio of used storage space to total available storage space, with higher ratios indicating better efficiency. |
| System Performance Metrics | Quantifiable measures of system performance, such as throughput, latency, and response time, which can be impacted by auto compaction. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of 121. Auto Compaction include:
* **Storage System Analysis**: The process of scanning storage systems to identify areas of inefficiency and opportunities for compaction.
* **Compaction Techniques**: The methods used to reclaim or reorganize unused space, such as defragmentation, compression, and data relocation.
* **Algorithmic Optimization**: The use of complex algorithms and heuristics to analyze storage usage patterns and apply compaction techniques in a way that maximizes storage efficiency and minimizes system impact.
* **Performance Monitoring**: The ongoing measurement and analysis of system performance metrics to ensure that auto compaction is operating effectively and efficiently.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for 121. Auto Compaction involves a periodic, background process that:
1. Scans storage systems to identify areas of inefficiency.
2. Applies compaction algorithms to analyze storage usage patterns and identify opportunities for compaction.
3. Reclaims or reorganizes unused space using compaction techniques.
4. Monitors system performance metrics to ensure that auto compaction is operating effectively and efficiently.
This model is widely accepted and recommended as a best practice for implementing auto compaction in storage systems.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for 121. Auto Compaction include:
* **Scheduled Compaction**: Scheduling auto compaction to run at regular intervals, such as daily or weekly, to maintain optimal storage efficiency.
* **Threshold-Based Compaction**: Configuring auto compaction to run when storage usage exceeds a certain threshold, such as 80% capacity.
* **Event-Driven Compaction**: Triggering auto compaction in response to specific events, such as system startup or shutdown.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for 121. Auto Compaction include:
* **Over-Compaction**: Running auto compaction too frequently, which can lead to unnecessary system overhead and performance degradation.
* **Under-Compaction**: Failing to run auto compaction regularly, which can lead to decreased storage efficiency and increased fragmentation.
* **Inadequate Monitoring**: Failing to monitor system performance metrics, which can lead to undetected issues with auto compaction.
