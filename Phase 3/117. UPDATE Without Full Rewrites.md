# 117. UPDATE Without Full Rewrites

Canonical documentation for 117. UPDATE Without Full Rewrites. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 117. UPDATE Without Full Rewrites exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The 117. UPDATE Without Full Rewrites approach is designed to address the need for efficient and targeted updates to existing data or code, without requiring a complete overhaul or rewrite. This is particularly useful in scenarios where only a small portion of the data or code requires modification, and a full rewrite would be unnecessary, time-consuming, and potentially introduce new errors.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The 117. UPDATE Without Full Rewrites concept involves a targeted and incremental update process, where only the specific components or data that require modification are updated, while leaving the remaining parts unchanged. This approach relies on a deep understanding of the existing system, data, or code, as well as the ability to identify and isolate the components that require updates.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Incremental Update | A targeted update that modifies only the specific components or data that require changes, without affecting the remaining parts. |
| Partial Rewrite | A rewrite that updates only a portion of the existing code or data, rather than replacing the entire system. |
| Delta Encoding | A technique used to encode only the changes (deltas) between two versions of data, rather than storing the entire dataset. |
| Patching | The process of applying incremental updates to existing code or data to fix errors, add new features, or modify behavior. |
| Version Control | A system that manages changes to code, data, or documents over time, allowing for the tracking of modifications and the maintenance of different versions. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of 117. UPDATE Without Full Rewrites include:
* **Incremental updates**: Targeted modifications to specific components or data, without affecting the remaining parts.
* **Change detection**: The ability to identify and isolate the components that require updates.
* **Delta encoding**: Encoding only the changes (deltas) between two versions of data, rather than storing the entire dataset.
* **Patching**: Applying incremental updates to existing code or data to fix errors, add new features, or modify behavior.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for 117. UPDATE Without Full Rewrites involves the following steps:
1. **Identify the changes**: Determine which components or data require updates.
2. **Isolate the changes**: Separate the components or data that require updates from the remaining parts.
3. **Apply the updates**: Modify the identified components or data with the required changes.
4. **Verify the updates**: Test and validate the updated components or data to ensure they function as expected.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for 117. UPDATE Without Full Rewrites include:
* **Incremental updates**: Regularly applying small, targeted updates to existing code or data.
* **Patching**: Applying fixes or modifications to existing code or data to address errors or add new features.
* **Delta encoding**: Using delta encoding to store only the changes between different versions of data.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for 117. UPDATE Without Full Rewrites include:
* **Full rewrites**: Completely rewriting existing code or data, rather than applying targeted updates.
* **Unnecessary updates**: Applying updates to components or data that do not require changes.
* **Insufficient testing**: Failing to thoroughly test and validate updated components or data.
