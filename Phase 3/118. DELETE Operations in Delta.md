# 118. DELETE Operations in Delta

Canonical documentation for 118. DELETE Operations in Delta. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
The 118. DELETE Operations in Delta exists to address the need for efficient and reliable deletion of data in Delta tables. Delta is a popular data storage format that provides ACID transactions, which enable multiple operations such as insert, update, and delete. The class of problems it addresses includes data management, data quality, and data compliance. Specifically, it helps to remove unwanted or obsolete data, maintain data consistency, and ensure adherence to regulatory requirements.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
The high-level mental model of 118. DELETE Operations in Delta involves a set of operations that allow users to delete data from Delta tables. This includes specifying the conditions for deletion, such as filtering rows based on certain criteria, and executing the deletion operation. The conceptual overview also encompasses the underlying mechanisms that ensure data consistency and integrity during the deletion process.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Delta Table | A table stored in Delta format, which supports ACID transactions and provides a scalable and reliable way to manage data. |
| DELETE Operation | An operation that removes data from a Delta table based on specified conditions. |
| Condition | A filter or predicate that specifies which rows to delete from a Delta table. |
| Transaction | A sequence of operations, including delete operations, that are executed as a single, all-or-nothing unit of work. |
| ACID Compliance | The guarantee that database transactions, including delete operations, follow the principles of Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. |

## 4. Core Concepts
The fundamental ideas that form the basis of 118. DELETE Operations in Delta include:
* **Data consistency**: Ensuring that the data remains consistent and accurate after deletion.
* **Transaction management**: Managing transactions to ensure that delete operations are executed reliably and efficiently.
* **Data filtering**: Specifying conditions to filter rows for deletion.
* **Error handling**: Handling errors and exceptions that may occur during the deletion process.

## 5. Standard Model
The generally accepted or recommended model for 118. DELETE Operations in Delta involves the following steps:
1. Specify the conditions for deletion using a WHERE clause.
2. Execute the DELETE operation using the Delta API or SQL syntax.
3. Verify the results of the deletion operation to ensure data consistency.

## 6. Common Patterns
Recurring, accepted patterns for 118. DELETE Operations in Delta include:
* **Periodic data purging**: Regularly deleting obsolete or unwanted data to maintain data quality and compliance.
* **Data archiving**: Deleting data from a Delta table and storing it in an archive for future reference.
* **Real-time data processing**: Deleting data in real-time to ensure that the data remains up-to-date and accurate.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Common but discouraged practices for 118. DELETE Operations in Delta include:
* **Deleting data without proper filtering**: Deleting data without specifying conditions, which can result in unintended data loss.
* **Not verifying deletion results**: Failing to verify the results of the deletion operation, which can lead to data inconsistencies.
* **Not handling errors**: Failing to handle errors and exceptions that may occur during the deletion process, which can compromise data integrity.
