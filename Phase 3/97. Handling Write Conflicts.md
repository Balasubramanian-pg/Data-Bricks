Canonical documentation for 97. Handling Write Conflicts. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 97. Handling Write Conflicts exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Handling write conflicts is a critical aspect of data management, particularly in distributed systems, collaborative environments, and concurrent data access scenarios. The primary purpose of handling write conflicts is to ensure data consistency and integrity when multiple entities attempt to modify the same data simultaneously. This document addresses the class of problems related to detecting, preventing, and resolving write conflicts, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding and implementing effective conflict handling strategies.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual model of handling write conflicts involves understanding the interactions between multiple writers, the data being modified, and the mechanisms for detecting and resolving conflicts. This model encompasses the following key components: data storage, write operations, conflict detection, and conflict resolution. By grasping these fundamental concepts, developers and system designers can develop effective strategies for managing write conflicts and ensuring data consistency.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Write Conflict | A situation where two or more entities attempt to modify the same data simultaneously, resulting in potential data inconsistency or loss. |
| Conflict Detection | The process of identifying write conflicts, typically through mechanisms such as locking, versioning, or hashing. |
| Conflict Resolution | The process of resolving write conflicts, which may involve techniques such as last-writer-wins, multi-version concurrency control, or manual intervention. |
| Data Consistency | The state of data being accurate, complete, and consistent across all replicas or versions. |
| Collaborative Environment | A system or application that allows multiple users or entities to access and modify shared data simultaneously. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of handling write conflicts include:
* **Conflict detection mechanisms**: Techniques such as locking, versioning, or hashing used to identify write conflicts.
* **Conflict resolution strategies**: Methods such as last-writer-wins, multi-version concurrency control, or manual intervention used to resolve write conflicts.
* **Data consistency models**: Theoretical frameworks that define the desired state of data consistency, such as strong consistency, eventual consistency, or weak consistency.
* **Collaborative environment design**: Principles and patterns for designing systems that support multiple users or entities accessing and modifying shared data simultaneously.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for handling write conflicts involves a combination of conflict detection and conflict resolution mechanisms. This model typically includes the following components:
* **Data storage**: A centralized or distributed repository that stores the data being modified.
* **Write operation handling**: A mechanism for processing write operations, which may involve locking, versioning, or other conflict detection techniques.
* **Conflict detection**: A process for identifying write conflicts, which may involve comparing version numbers, timestamps, or other metadata.
* **Conflict resolution**: A process for resolving write conflicts, which may involve techniques such as last-writer-wins, multi-version concurrency control, or manual intervention.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for handling write conflicts include:
* **Optimistic concurrency control**: A strategy that assumes conflicts are rare and resolves them using techniques such as last-writer-wins or multi-version concurrency control.
* **Pessimistic concurrency control**: A strategy that assumes conflicts are frequent and prevents them using techniques such as locking or versioning.
* **Manual conflict resolution**: A process that involves human intervention to resolve write conflicts, often used in collaborative environments.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for handling write conflicts include:
* **Ignoring conflicts**: Failing to detect or resolve write conflicts, which can lead to data inconsistency or loss.
* **Using a single, global lock**: Implementing a locking mechanism that prevents all concurrent write operations, which can lead to performance bottlenecks and scalability issues.
* **Relying on last-writer-wins**: Using a conflict resolution strategy that always favors the last writer, which can lead to data loss or inconsistency.
