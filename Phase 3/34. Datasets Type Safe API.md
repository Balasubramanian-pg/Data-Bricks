# 34. Datasets Type Safe API

Canonical documentation for 34. Datasets Type Safe API. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
The 34. Datasets Type Safe API exists to provide a robust and reliable interface for interacting with datasets in a type-safe manner. It addresses the class of problems related to data integrity, consistency, and security by ensuring that datasets are handled and manipulated in a way that prevents errors and inconsistencies. The API is designed to provide a standardized and predictable way of working with datasets, making it easier to develop and maintain applications that rely on data-driven insights.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
The 34. Datasets Type Safe API is based on a conceptual model that views datasets as collections of typed data elements. The API provides a set of operations and interfaces that allow developers to create, read, update, and delete datasets in a type-safe manner. The conceptual model is centered around the idea of a dataset as a first-class citizen, with a well-defined structure and semantics that can be reasoned about and manipulated programmatically.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Dataset | A collection of typed data elements, such as numbers, strings, or objects, that are organized and structured in a specific way. |
| Type Safety | The property of a programming language or API that ensures the correctness and consistency of data types at compile-time or runtime. |
| Data Element | A single unit of data, such as a number or string, that is part of a larger dataset. |
| Dataset Schema | A definition of the structure and organization of a dataset, including the types and relationships of its data elements. |
| Type Inference | The ability of the API to automatically determine the types of data elements in a dataset based on their values or other contextual information. |

## 4. Core Concepts
The 34. Datasets Type Safe API is based on several core concepts, including:
* **Type Safety**: The API ensures that datasets are handled and manipulated in a type-safe manner, preventing errors and inconsistencies that can arise from incorrect or incompatible data types.
* **Dataset Schema**: The API provides a way to define and work with dataset schemas, which describe the structure and organization of a dataset.
* **Data Element**: The API views data elements as first-class citizens, providing a set of operations and interfaces for working with individual data elements.
* **Type Inference**: The API provides type inference capabilities, allowing developers to automatically determine the types of data elements in a dataset.

## 5. Standard Model
The standard model for the 34. Datasets Type Safe API is based on a simple and intuitive architecture that consists of the following components:
* **Dataset**: The central component of the API, representing a collection of typed data elements.
* **Dataset Schema**: A definition of the structure and organization of a dataset.
* **Data Element**: A single unit of data that is part of a larger dataset.
* **Type System**: A set of rules and constraints that govern the types of data elements in a dataset.

## 6. Common Patterns
Some common patterns and use cases for the 34. Datasets Type Safe API include:
* **Creating and managing datasets**: Developers can use the API to create, read, update, and delete datasets in a type-safe manner.
* **Defining and working with dataset schemas**: The API provides a way to define and work with dataset schemas, making it easier to understand and manipulate the structure and organization of datasets.
* **Performing data element operations**: The API provides a set of operations and interfaces for working with individual data elements, such as filtering, sorting, and aggregating.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Some common anti-patterns and pitfalls to avoid when using the 34. Datasets Type Safe API include:
* **Ignoring type safety**: Failing to ensure type safety when working with datasets can lead to errors and inconsistencies that can be difficult to debug and fix.
* **Not defining a dataset schema**: Failing to define a dataset schema can make it difficult to understand and manipulate the structure and organization of a dataset.
* **Not using type inference**: Failing to use type inference capabilities can lead to manual and error-prone type definitions.
