# 99. VERSION AS OF Syntax

Canonical documentation for 99. VERSION AS OF Syntax. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 99. VERSION AS OF Syntax exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The 99. VERSION AS OF Syntax is designed to provide a standardized method for specifying the version of a system, component, or document as of a particular point in time. This syntax addresses the need for clear and unambiguous version identification, which is crucial in various fields such as software development, documentation, and regulatory compliance. The primary problem it solves is the lack of a consistent and widely adopted format for versioning, which can lead to confusion, errors, and difficulties in tracking changes.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The 99. VERSION AS OF Syntax operates on the principle of providing a unique identifier that combines a version number with a timestamp or date, indicating the point in time when the version was current. This approach enables the creation of a version history, allowing users to track changes, updates, and revisions over time. The syntax is designed to be flexible, adaptable to various contexts, and easy to understand and implement.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Version | A specific iteration or release of a system, component, or document. |
| Version Number | A unique identifier assigned to a version, often in the format of major.minor.patch. |
| Timestamp | A specific point in time, usually represented in a format like YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ. |
| Syntax | The set of rules that defines the structure of the 99. VERSION AS OF expression. |
| Expression | The combination of version number and timestamp according to the defined syntax. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of the 99. VERSION AS OF Syntax include:
- **Version Identification**: The ability to uniquely identify a version of a system, component, or document.
- **Timestamping**: The association of a version with a specific point in time.
- **Expression Format**: The standardized structure for combining version numbers and timestamps into a single expression.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for the 99. VERSION AS OF Syntax is `VERSION v.x.y AS OF YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`, where:
- `v.x.y` represents the version number in major.minor.patch format.
- `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ` represents the timestamp in ISO 8601 format.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns include:
- Using the syntax in documentation headers or footers to indicate the version and last update time.
- Incorporating the syntax into automated build or deployment scripts to track version history.
- Utilizing the syntax in regulatory or compliance documents to provide clear version and timestamp information.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns include:
- Using ambiguous or non-standard version numbering schemes.
- Failing to update the version or timestamp when changes are made.
- Not providing a clear and accessible version history.
