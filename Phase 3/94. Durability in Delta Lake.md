# 94. Durability in Delta Lake

Canonical documentation for 94. Durability in Delta Lake. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 94. Durability in Delta Lake exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Durability in Delta Lake is designed to provide a reliable and fault-tolerant storage solution for big data and analytics workloads. The primary problem it addresses is ensuring that data is consistently and accurately written to and read from storage, even in the presence of failures or concurrent modifications. This is particularly important in distributed systems, where data is often split across multiple nodes and devices.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Delta Lake is a storage layer that provides ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions, allowing for reliable and efficient data management. The durability aspect of Delta Lake ensures that once data is written, it is guaranteed to be persisted and available for future reads, even in the event of failures or system crashes.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| ACID | A set of properties that ensure database transactions are processed reliably: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability |
| Delta Lake | An open-source storage layer that provides a reliable and efficient way to store and manage big data and analytics workloads |
| Durability | The guarantee that once data is written, it is persisted and available for future reads, even in the event of failures or system crashes |
| Transaction | A sequence of operations that are executed as a single, all-or-nothing unit of work |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of durability in Delta Lake include:
* **Atomicity**: Ensuring that transactions are executed as a single, all-or-nothing unit of work
* **Consistency**: Ensuring that the data remains in a consistent state, even after multiple transactions have been applied
* **Isolation**: Ensuring that concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other
* **Durability**: Ensuring that once data is written, it is persisted and available for future reads

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for durability in Delta Lake involves using a combination of techniques, including:
* **Checkpoints**: Periodically saving the state of the system to ensure that progress is not lost in the event of a failure
* **Journaling**: Writing a record of all transactions to a separate log, allowing for efficient recovery in the event of a failure
* **Replication**: Duplicating data across multiple nodes or devices to ensure that it is available even in the event of a failure

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for achieving durability in Delta Lake include:
* **Batch processing**: Processing data in batches to ensure that transactions are executed efficiently and reliably
* **Streaming data integration**: Integrating streaming data sources with Delta Lake to provide real-time data processing and analysis
* **Data versioning**: Using versioning to track changes to data over time, allowing for efficient auditing and debugging

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for durability in Delta Lake include:
* **Not using transactions**: Failing to use transactions can result in data inconsistencies and loss of durability
* **Not configuring checkpoints**: Failing to configure checkpoints can result in data loss in the event of a failure
* **Not monitoring system health**: Failing to monitor system health can result in undetected failures and data loss
