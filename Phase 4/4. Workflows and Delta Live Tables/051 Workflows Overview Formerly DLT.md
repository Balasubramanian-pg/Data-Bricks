# Workflows Overview Formerly DLT

Canonical documentation for Workflows Overview Formerly DLT. This document defines concepts, terminology, and standard usage.

## Purpose

The Workflows Overview Formerly DLT topic exists to provide a comprehensive understanding of workflow management systems, formerly known as Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). This topic addresses the problem space of managing complex, distributed workflows across multiple stakeholders, systems, and organizations. The goal is to provide a standardized framework for designing, implementing, and maintaining workflows, ensuring interoperability, scalability, and security. This documentation aims to bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and practical applications, enabling organizations to leverage workflow management systems to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance decision-making.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is intended to be implementation-agnostic and authoritative.

## Scope

The scope of this topic includes the concepts, terminology, and standard usage of workflow management systems, with a focus on the evolution from DLT. The following aspects are in scope:

**In scope:**
* Workflow design patterns and principles
* Distributed ledger technology (DLT) fundamentals
* Interoperability and integration with existing systems
* Security, scalability, and performance considerations

**Out of scope:**
* Tool-specific implementations (e.g., Hyperledger, Corda)
* Vendor-specific behavior and proprietary solutions
* Detailed technical specifications for individual workflow management systems

## Definitions

The following terms are used throughout this documentation:

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Workflow | A series of tasks, processes, or activities that are coordinated and managed to achieve a specific goal or outcome |
| Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) | A decentralized, digital ledger that records transactions and data across a network of nodes, ensuring transparency, immutability, and security |
| Node | A participant in a DLT network, responsible for validating and storing transactions and data |
| Smart Contract | A self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement written directly into lines of code, automating the enforcement and execution of the contract |

> [!TIP]
> Definitions should be stable over time; avoid contextual language.

## Core Concepts

The fundamental ideas that make up the Workflows Overview Formerly DLT topic include:

### Workflow Design
The process of creating and optimizing workflows to achieve specific business objectives, taking into account factors such as efficiency, scalability, and security.

### Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)
The underlying technology that enables the creation of a decentralized, digital ledger, allowing for secure, transparent, and tamper-proof data storage and transaction management.

### Interoperability
The ability of different workflow management systems to communicate and exchange data seamlessly, ensuring seamless integration and coordination across multiple stakeholders and systems.

## Standard Model

The standard model for workflow management systems involves the following components:

1. **Workflow Design**: Define and model the workflow, including tasks, processes, and activities.
2. **DLT Integration**: Integrate the workflow with a DLT network, ensuring secure and transparent data storage and transaction management.
3. **Node Management**: Manage and coordinate nodes within the DLT network, ensuring validation and storage of transactions and data.
4. **Smart Contract Execution**: Automate the execution of smart contracts, ensuring enforcement and compliance with agreed-upon terms and conditions.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deviations from the standard model should be explicitly documented and justified.

## Common Patterns

Recurring patterns and approaches associated with workflow management systems include:

* **Hub-and-Spoke Model**: A centralized hub coordinates and manages multiple spokes, each representing a separate workflow or system.
* **Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)**: A decentralized, autonomous organization that operates on a DLT network, making decisions and executing actions based on predefined rules and smart contracts.

## Anti-Patterns

Common mistakes or discouraged practices in workflow management systems include:

> [!WARNING]
> These anti-patterns often lead to maintenance or scalability issues.

* **Centralized Control**: Relying on a single, centralized authority to manage and control the workflow, leading to single points of failure and decreased scalability.
* **Lack of Standardization**: Failing to establish standardized workflow design patterns and principles, resulting in increased complexity and decreased interoperability.

## Edge Cases

Unusual, ambiguous, or boundary scenarios related to workflow management systems include:

> [!CAUTION]
> Edge cases are frequently overlooked and may cause incorrect assumptions.

* **Network Congestion**: High volumes of transactions and data causing network congestion, leading to decreased performance and increased latency.
* **Smart Contract Vulnerabilities**: Exploitable vulnerabilities in smart contracts, potentially leading to security breaches and financial losses.
