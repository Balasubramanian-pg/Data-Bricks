# Job Cost Tracking Per Run

Canonical documentation for Job Cost Tracking Per Run. This document defines concepts, terminology, and standard usage.

## Purpose

Job Cost Tracking Per Run is a critical aspect of operational management, particularly in industries where jobs or projects are executed repeatedly, such as manufacturing, construction, and IT services. The primary purpose of Job Cost Tracking Per Run is to accurately capture, analyze, and control the costs associated with each job or project execution. This enables organizations to optimize resource allocation, improve profitability, and make informed decisions about future projects. By tracking costs per run, organizations can identify areas of inefficiency, reduce waste, and enhance their overall competitiveness.

## Scope

**In scope:**
* Cost collection and analysis methodologies
* Job costing principles and standards
* Integration with accounting and project management systems

**Out of scope:**
* Tool-specific implementations (e.g., ERP, accounting software)
* Vendor-specific behavior and proprietary systems
* Detailed financial accounting and tax implications

## Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Job | A specific project or task executed by an organization, with defined objectives, timelines, and resource allocations. |
| Cost | The monetary value of resources (e.g., labor, materials, equipment) consumed during a job execution. |
| Run | A single execution of a job, which may be repeated multiple times. |
| Cost Tracking | The process of collecting, analyzing, and reporting costs associated with each job run. |
| Cost Center | A functional area or department within an organization responsible for incurring costs. |

> [!TIP]
> Definitions should be stable over time; avoid contextual language.

## Core Concepts

### Job Cost Structure
The job cost structure refers to the categorization and organization of costs associated with a job. This typically includes direct costs (e.g., labor, materials), indirect costs (e.g., overhead, utilities), and other expenses (e.g., travel, training).

### Cost Allocation
Cost allocation is the process of assigning costs to specific jobs, cost centers, or departments. This can be done using various methods, such as absorption costing, marginal costing, or activity-based costing.

## Standard Model

The standard model for Job Cost Tracking Per Run involves the following steps:
1. **Job definition**: Define the job scope, objectives, and timelines.
2. **Cost estimation**: Estimate the costs associated with the job, including direct and indirect costs.
3. **Cost tracking**: Collect and record costs incurred during the job execution.
4. **Cost analysis**: Analyze the actual costs and compare them to the estimated costs.
5. **Cost reporting**: Report the cost results to stakeholders, including management, project teams, and customers.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deviations from the standard model should be explicitly documented and justified.

## Common Patterns

* **Periodic cost reviews**: Regularly review and analyze costs to identify trends, anomalies, and areas for improvement.
* **Cost benchmarking**: Compare costs with industry benchmarks or internal standards to assess performance.
* **Root cause analysis**: Investigate and address the underlying causes of cost variances or anomalies.

## Anti-Patterns

* **Inaccurate cost estimation**: Failing to accurately estimate costs, leading to cost overruns or underestimation.
* **Inadequate cost tracking**: Failing to collect and record costs accurately, leading to incomplete or inaccurate cost data.
* **Lack of cost analysis**: Failing to analyze costs and identify areas for improvement, leading to inefficient resource allocation.

> [!WARNING]
> These anti-patterns often lead to maintenance or scalability issues, and can result in significant financial losses.

## Edge Cases

* **Job cancellations**: Handling costs associated with cancelled jobs, including sunk costs and potential penalties.
* **Scope changes**: Managing costs associated with changes to the job scope, including additional work or reduced work.
* **Unforeseen events**: Dealing with unexpected events, such as natural disasters or supply chain disruptions, that impact job costs.

> [!CAUTION]
> Edge cases are frequently overlooked and may cause incorrect assumptions or cost estimation errors.
