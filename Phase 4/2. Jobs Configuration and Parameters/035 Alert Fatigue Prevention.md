# Alert Fatigue Prevention

Canonical documentation for Alert Fatigue Prevention. This document defines concepts, terminology, and standard usage.

## Purpose

Alert Fatigue Prevention exists to address the problem of desensitization to alerts, warnings, and notifications in complex systems. As the volume and frequency of alerts increase, users may become less responsive to critical notifications, leading to decreased system reliability, reduced situational awareness, and compromised decision-making. This topic aims to provide guidance on designing and implementing effective alert management strategies to mitigate alert fatigue and ensure that critical information is conveyed to users in a timely and actionable manner.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is intended to be implementation-agnostic and authoritative.

## Scope

Clarify what is in scope and out of scope for this topic.

**In scope:**
* Alert filtering and prioritization
* Notification threshold management
* User interface design for alert presentation

**Out of scope:**
* Tool-specific implementations (e.g., specific monitoring software or programming languages)
* Vendor-specific behavior (e.g., proprietary alert handling mechanisms)
* Detailed discussion of human factors and psychology (although these topics may be touched upon in the context of alert design)

## Definitions

Provide precise definitions for key terms used throughout the documentation.

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Alert | A notification or warning message generated by a system to inform users of a specific event, condition, or anomaly. |
| Alert Fatigue | A state of desensitization to alerts, warnings, and notifications, resulting in decreased responsiveness to critical information. |
| Notification Threshold | The minimum severity or priority level at which an alert is triggered and presented to the user. |
| Alert Suppression | The intentional hiding or dismissal of alerts to prevent unnecessary notifications. |

> [!TIP]
> Definitions should be stable over time; avoid contextual language.

## Core Concepts

Explain the fundamental ideas that make up the topic.

### Alert Filtering
Alert filtering refers to the process of selectively presenting alerts to users based on predefined criteria, such as severity, priority, or relevance. Effective alert filtering helps reduce the overall volume of alerts and minimizes the likelihood of alert fatigue.

### Alert Prioritization
Alert prioritization involves assigning a level of importance or urgency to each alert, allowing users to focus on the most critical notifications first. Prioritization can be based on factors like business impact, system risk, or user role.

## Standard Model

Describe the generally accepted or recommended model for this topic.

The standard model for Alert Fatigue Prevention involves a multi-step approach:
1. **Alert Classification**: Categorize alerts based on their severity, priority, or type.
2. **Notification Threshold Management**: Establish and adjust notification thresholds to balance alert volume and user responsiveness.
3. **Alert Filtering and Prioritization**: Implement filtering and prioritization mechanisms to present users with relevant and actionable alerts.
4. **User Interface Design**: Design intuitive and effective user interfaces for alert presentation, taking into account factors like visual hierarchy, color coding, and notification timing.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deviations from the standard model should be explicitly documented and justified.

## Common Patterns

Document recurring patterns or approaches associated with this topic.

* **Tiered Alerting**: Using multiple levels of alerting (e.g., warning, error, critical) to convey varying degrees of severity or urgency.
* **Alert Escalation**: Gradually increasing the severity or priority of alerts as a situation worsens or remains unaddressed.

## Anti-Patterns

Describe common mistakes or discouraged practices.

> [!WARNING]
> These anti-patterns often lead to maintenance or scalability issues.

* **Alert Spamming**: Generating excessive numbers of alerts, often due to overly sensitive monitoring thresholds or inadequate filtering.
* **Insufficient Alert Context**: Failing to provide users with sufficient information about the alert, such as relevant metrics, logs, or troubleshooting guidance.

## Edge Cases

Explain unusual, ambiguous, or boundary scenarios related to the topic.

> [!CAUTION]
> Edge cases are frequently overlooked and may cause incorrect assumptions.

* **Alert Overload during System Initialization**: Managing alerts during system startup or initialization, when the volume of alerts may be higher than usual.
* **Alert Handling during Maintenance Windows**: Coordinating alert suppression or filtering during scheduled maintenance periods to minimize unnecessary notifications.

## Related Topics

Link to adjacent or dependent topics.

* **Human-Computer Interaction**: The study of how users interact with systems and respond to alerts, warnings, and notifications.
