# 147. Post Mortem Process

Canonical documentation for [147. Post Mortem Process](Phase 6/147. Post Mortem Process.md). This document defines concepts, terminology, and standard usage.

## Purpose
The Post Mortem Process exists to facilitate organizational learning and systemic improvement following a significant event, typically a failure or service degradation. Its primary objective is to identify the root causes of an incident and implement preventative measures to ensure the issue does not recur. By shifting the focus from individual culpability to systemic resilience, the process transforms negative outcomes into valuable institutional knowledge.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is intended to be implementation-agnostic and authoritative, focusing on the structural and cultural requirements of the process rather than specific software tools.

## Scope
The Post Mortem Process encompasses the entire lifecycle of incident analysis, from the initial resolution of the event to the final verification of corrective actions.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **In scope:**
> * Formal analysis of service disruptions, security breaches, or significant project failures.
> * Identification of systemic vulnerabilities and contributing factors.
> * Documentation of timelines, impact, and resolution steps.
> * Generation and tracking of actionable remediation tasks.
> * Cultivation of a blameless culture.

> [!WARNING]
> **Out of scope:**
> * Specific vendor implementations or incident management software.
> * Performance reviews or disciplinary actions against individuals.
> * Real-time incident response and mitigation (which occurs prior to the post mortem).

## Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Blamelessness | A cultural framework that assumes all employees acted with the best intentions and information available, focusing on system flaws rather than human error. |
| Root Cause | The fundamental, underlying reason for an occurrence which, if corrected, would prevent recurrence. |
| Contributing Factor | A condition or event that influenced the outcome but was not the sole cause of the incident. |
| Action Item | A specific, measurable, and assigned task designed to improve the system or process based on post mortem findings. |
| Near Miss | An event that did not result in a failure but had the potential to do so under slightly different circumstances. |
| MTTR | Mean Time To Recovery; a metric often analyzed during post mortems to evaluate response efficiency. |

## Core Concepts
The Post Mortem Process is built upon the principle of **Systemic Resilience**. It recognizes that complex systems are inherently prone to failure and that "human error" is usually a symptom of deeper systemic issues (e.g., poor UI design, lack of automation, or inadequate training).

> [!TIP]
> Think of a post mortem as an "autopsy" for a technical failure. The goal is not to punish the body for dying, but to understand the disease or trauma so that others may be vaccinated or protected in the future.

### Psychological Safety
For the process to be effective, participants must feel safe sharing their mistakes and observations without fear of retribution. Without psychological safety, the data gathered will be incomplete or biased, leading to ineffective remediation.

### The "Five Whys"
A core analytical technique used to peel away layers of symptoms to reach the root cause. By repeatedly asking "Why?", investigators move past the immediate technical trigger to find the procedural or architectural weakness.

## Standard Model
The standard model for a Post Mortem Process follows a structured five-phase lifecycle:

1.  **Detection and Resolution:** The incident is identified, mitigated, and resolved. The post mortem clock begins once the system is stable.
2.  **Data Gathering:** Stakeholders compile logs, chat transcripts, metrics, and personal accounts to build an objective timeline of events.
3.  **The Analysis Meeting:** A facilitated discussion where the timeline is reviewed, and the root cause is identified using collaborative techniques.
4.  **Documentation:** A formal report is drafted, detailing the "What," "How," "Why," and "What's Next."
5.  **Follow-up:** Action items are tracked to completion. The process is not considered "closed" until the systemic fixes are implemented.

## Common Patterns
*   **The Timeline-First Approach:** Establishing a shared, objective reality of "what happened when" before attempting to diagnose "why."
*   **Broad Participation:** Including representatives from engineering, product, customer support, and management to gain a 360-degree view of the impact.
*   **Public Dissemination:** Sharing the final report internally (and sometimes externally) to maximize the learning benefit across the entire organization.

## Anti-Patterns
*   **The Blame Game:** Identifying a specific person as the "cause" of the incident.
*   **The "Write-Only" Report:** Completing the documentation but never assigning or completing the resulting action items.
*   **Analysis Paralysis:** Spending excessive time on minor incidents that do not warrant a full post mortem, leading to "post mortem fatigue."
*   **Punitive Action Items:** Creating tasks that add "more process" or "more approvals" without addressing the underlying technical vulnerability.

> [!CAUTION]
> Avoid circular dependencies where the proposed solution to an incident relies on the very system that failed during the incident.

## Edge Cases
*   **Near Misses:** High-severity incidents that were avoided by luck or heroic effort. These should often trigger a post mortem despite the lack of actual downtime.
*   **Security Incidents:** These require a modified post mortem process to handle sensitive information and potential legal implications while still capturing systemic learnings.
*   **Recurring Minor Issues:** While a single minor issue may not trigger a post mortem, a pattern of "death by a thousand cuts" may require a thematic post mortem to address the aggregate impact.
