# 139. Platform Wide Alerts

Canonical documentation for [139. Platform Wide Alerts](Phase 6/139. Platform Wide Alerts.md). This document defines concepts, terminology, and standard usage.

## Purpose
Platform Wide Alerts serve as a centralized mechanism for broadcasting critical, time-sensitive, or universally relevant information to all active participants within a digital ecosystem. The primary objective is to ensure that systemic status changes, emergency notifications, or mandatory compliance updates are communicated with high visibility and consistency, regardless of a user's specific location or activity within the platform.

This topic addresses the challenge of fragmented communication by providing a "single source of truth" for environmental health and administrative announcements, preventing information silos during critical events.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is intended to be implementation-agnostic and authoritative, focusing on the architectural and logic-based requirements of global notification systems.

## Scope
The scope of this document covers the theoretical framework, management, and propagation of alerts that affect the platform as a whole or significant, cross-functional segments of the user base.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **In scope:**
> * Global state management of alert entities.
> * Severity classification and prioritization logic.
> * Persistence and dismissal logic across sessions.
> * Propagation strategies for distributed systems.

> [!WARNING]
> **Out of scope:**
> * Specific vendor implementations (e.g., AWS SNS, Azure SignalR, or specific JavaScript toast libraries).
> * Localized transactional notifications (e.g., "Password changed successfully").
> * Marketing-driven "in-app messaging" or promotional pop-ups.

## Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Broadcast | The act of transmitting an alert to all connected nodes or users simultaneously. |
| Persistence | The quality of an alert remaining visible or accessible across multiple sessions or page navigations until a specific condition is met. |
| Dismissibility | The capability for a user to acknowledge and hide an alert, often stored as a stateful preference. |
| Severity Level | A classification (e.g., Critical, Warning, Info) that determines the visual prominence and interruptive nature of the alert. |
| Propagation Delay | The time elapsed between the issuance of a platform-wide alert and its visibility to the final end-user. |
| TTL (Time to Live) | The expiration duration after which an alert is automatically decommissioned by the system. |

## Core Concepts

### The Centralized Registry
Platform Wide Alerts must originate from a centralized registry or "Alert Store." This ensures that the state of the platform is consistent for all users. When an alert is published, it is pushed to or pulled by all active clients, ensuring that the "Current State" of the platform is synchronized.

### Severity and Hierarchy
Not all global messages carry the same weight. A standard model utilizes a hierarchy:
1.  **Critical/Emergency:** System outages, security breaches, or immediate data loss risks.
2.  **Warning:** Scheduled maintenance, degraded performance, or upcoming deprecations.
3.  **Informational:** New feature announcements, policy updates, or general platform news.

> [!TIP]
> Think of Platform Wide Alerts like a building's fire alarm system versus its public address system. A fire alarm (Critical) requires immediate, universal attention and overrides all other noise, while a general announcement (Info) provides context without demanding an immediate halt to activity.

### State Synchronization
Because these alerts are platform-wide, the system must track whether an alert has been "seen" or "dismissed." This state can be stored locally (client-side) for anonymous users or globally (server-side) for authenticated users to ensure a seamless experience across different devices.

## Standard Model
The standard model for Platform Wide Alerts follows a **Publish-Subscribe (Pub/Sub)** architecture combined with a **Stateful Overlay**.

1.  **Administrative Trigger:** An authorized actor or automated system monitors a condition and publishes an alert object to the Central Registry.
2.  **Distribution Layer:** The system broadcasts the alert object. In modern architectures, this often involves a websocket connection for real-time delivery or a high-frequency polling mechanism.
3.  **Client-Side Interceptor:** The application shell (the outermost layer of the UI) listens for these objects. Because the alert is "Platform Wide," it exists outside the scope of individual pages or components.
4.  **Rendering Logic:** The UI renders the alert based on its severity. Critical alerts often utilize "Modal" or "Banner" patterns that shift the layout, while Info alerts may use non-intrusive "Toasts" or "Notification Centers."

## Common Patterns

### The Global Banner
A persistent strip at the top or bottom of the viewport. This is the most common pattern for maintenance windows. It remains visible as the user navigates through different sections of the platform.

### The Acknowledgment Gate
For legal or security updates, the platform may require the user to interact with the alert (e.g., clicking "I Understand") before they can resume normal operations. This pattern ensures 100% visibility and compliance.

### The Retroactive Feed
A "Notification Center" where past platform-wide alerts are archived. This allows users who were offline during a broadcast to review important system changes they might have missed.

## Anti-Patterns

### Alert Fatigue
The most common failure in platform-wide systems is the over-use of "Critical" or "High" priority for non-essential information. When everything is urgent, nothing is urgent.

### Localized Logic for Global Events
Hard-coding alerts into specific pages rather than the global application shell. This leads to "flicker" where the alert disappears and reappears during navigation, or worse, is missed entirely if the user stays on a specific sub-page.

### Lack of Expiration (Zombie Alerts)
Failing to set a TTL (Time to Live) or an end-date for alerts. This results in users seeing "Scheduled Maintenance" banners for maintenance that occurred weeks ago.

> [!CAUTION]
> Avoid tight coupling between the alert system and specific functional modules. If the "Billing Module" fails, the "Platform Alert System" must remain functional to notify users of the failure.

## Edge Cases

### The "Thundering Herd" Problem
When a platform-wide alert is triggered, especially one that requires a user action (like "Refresh to Update"), it can cause a massive spike in traffic as thousands of users hit the backend simultaneously. Systems must be designed to stagger these actions or handle the load.

### Time-Zone Sensitivity
An alert announcing "Maintenance at 12:00 PM" is ambiguous in a global platform. Standard models must always use UTC for the backend logic and translate to the user's local time-zone in the UI.

### Offline/Reconnection Sync
If a user's device loses connectivity, the system must reconcile the alert state upon reconnection. The user should receive any critical alerts that were issued while they were offline.
