# 146. Incident Response Procedures

Canonical documentation for [146. Incident Response Procedures](Phase 6/146. Incident Response Procedures.md). This document defines concepts, terminology, and standard usage.

## Purpose
Incident Response (IR) Procedures exist to provide a structured, systematic approach to managing the aftermath of a security breach, operational failure, or unexpected service disruption. The primary objective is to limit damage, reduce recovery time and costs, and ensure that lessons learned are integrated into future preventative measures. By establishing a predefined set of actions, organizations can move from a reactive, chaotic state to a controlled, methodical recovery process.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is intended to be implementation-agnostic and authoritative, focusing on the architectural and procedural requirements rather than specific software tooling.

## Scope
This documentation covers the lifecycle of an incident from preparation through post-incident analysis.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **In scope:**
> * The lifecycle phases of incident management.
> * Roles and responsibilities within an Incident Response Team (IRT).
> * Communication protocols and escalation paths.
> * Classification and prioritization frameworks.

> [!WARNING]
> **Out of scope:**
> * Specific vendor-specific configurations (e.g., AWS CloudWatch settings or Azure Sentinel playbooks).
> * Legal advice regarding specific jurisdictional data breach notification laws.
> * Disaster Recovery (DR) for long-term business continuity (though IR and DR are related).

## Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Incident | An occurrence that actually or potentially jeopardizes the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an information system. |
| Event | Any observable occurrence in a network or system; not all events are incidents. |
| Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) | The average time it takes for an organization to become aware of a potential security incident. |
| Mean Time to Respond (MTTR) | The average time taken to neutralize a threat once it has been identified. |
| Playbook | A documented set of specific steps to be taken in response to a particular type of incident (e.g., Ransomware Playbook). |
| Severity Level | A classification (e.g., SEV-1, SEV-2) indicating the impact of an incident on the business. |
| Incident Commander (IC) | The individual responsible for leading the response, making high-level decisions, and coordinating resources. |

## Core Concepts
The fundamental philosophy of Incident Response is that "failure is inevitable, but recovery is manageable." 

### The Incident Lifecycle
Incident response is not a single action but a continuous cycle. The most widely accepted frameworks (such as NIST SP 800-61) divide this into distinct phases: Preparation, Detection/Analysis, Containment/Eradication, and Recovery/Post-Incident Activity.

### Triage and Prioritization
Not all incidents are equal. Effective procedures require a mechanism to categorize incidents based on functional impact, information impact, and recoverability. This prevents "alert fatigue" and ensures that critical resources are directed toward the highest-risk threats.

> [!TIP]
> Think of Incident Response like a hospital emergency room: Triage determines who needs immediate surgery (SEV-1) versus who can wait for a consultation (SEV-3). Without triage, the system collapses under the weight of minor issues.

## Standard Model
The standard model for Incident Response Procedures follows a linear progression with a feedback loop:

1.  **Preparation:** Establishing the IR team, defining tools, and hardening systems before an incident occurs.
2.  **Detection and Analysis:** Identifying signs of an incident (indicators of compromise) and validating the scope and magnitude.
3.  **Containment:** 
    *   *Short-term:* Stopping the immediate "bleeding" (e.g., isolating a network segment).
    *   *Long-term:* Implementing temporary fixes to allow systems to function while a permanent solution is developed.
4.  **Eradication:** Removing the root cause of the incident (e.g., deleting malware, closing exploited vulnerabilities).
5.  **Recovery:** Restoring systems to normal operation and verifying that they are functioning correctly.
6.  **Post-Incident Activity:** Conducting a "Lessons Learned" session to document the timeline and improve future response.

## Common Patterns
*   **The War Room:** Creating a centralized communication channel (physical or virtual) where all stakeholders share real-time updates.
*   **On-Call Rotations:** Distributing the responsibility of initial response across a team to ensure 24/7 coverage without burnout.
*   **Automated Triggering:** Using scripts or logic to automatically initiate containment (e.g., disabling a user account after five failed login attempts from a new IP).
*   **Standardized Severity Tiers:** Using a 3-to-5 tier system to communicate urgency across the entire organization.

## Anti-Patterns
*   **Blame Culture:** Focusing on "who" caused the incident rather than "what" allowed it to happen. This leads to information withholding.
*   **The "Hero" Complex:** Relying on a single individual's tribal knowledge to resolve incidents rather than documented procedures.
*   **Silent Failures:** Resolving an incident without documenting it or performing a post-mortem, ensuring the same incident will happen again.
*   **Over-Communication:** Flooding technical responders with status requests from management, which distracts from the recovery efforts.

> [!CAUTION]
> Avoid circular dependencies in your IR plan. For example, if your IR procedures are stored on a server that is encrypted during a ransomware attack, the team cannot access the instructions needed to respond.

## Edge Cases
*   **The "Insider Threat":** Procedures must account for incidents where the responder or a high-level administrator is the malicious actor. This requires "out-of-band" communication and restricted access.
*   **Third-Party/Supply Chain Breach:** When the incident occurs in a vendor's environment but affects your data. Procedures must define the boundaries of responsibility and legal requirements for notification.
*   **False Positives at Scale:** A massive influx of alerts that look like an incident but are caused by a misconfigured monitoring tool or a scheduled deployment.
*   **Legal/Regulatory Triggers:** Incidents that are technically minor but involve sensitive data (PII/PHI) that trigger mandatory legal reporting windows (e.g., GDPR's 72-hour window).

*   **Disaster Recovery (DR):** The technical process of restoring infrastructure and data after a catastrophic failure.
*   **Threat Hunting:** Proactively searching for signs of an incident before an alert is triggered.
*   **Root Cause Analysis (RCA):** The deep-dive investigation performed after recovery to identify the fundamental weakness.
