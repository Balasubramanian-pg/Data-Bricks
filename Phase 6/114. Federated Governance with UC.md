# 114. Federated Governance with UC

Canonical documentation for [114. Federated Governance with UC](Phase 6/114. Federated Governance with UC.md). This document defines concepts, terminology, and standard usage.

## Purpose
Federated Governance with UC (Unity Catalog) addresses the tension between centralized control and decentralized agility in modern data ecosystems. As organizations scale, a single central team can no longer manage every data asset, permission, and metadata entry without becoming a bottleneck. Conversely, complete decentralization leads to data silos, inconsistent security postures, and a lack of discoverability.

This topic defines a framework where a central authority establishes global standards, security baselines, and audit requirements, while individual business units or domains retain autonomy over their specific data lifecycles, access grants, and domain-specific metadata.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is intended to be implementation-agnostic regarding specific cloud providers, focusing instead on the architectural principles of unified cataloging and federated administration.

## Scope
Clarify what is in scope and out of scope for this topic.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **In scope:**
> * Hierarchical governance structures (Account vs. Metastore vs. Catalog).
> * Delegation of administrative privileges.
> * Global vs. Local policy enforcement.
> * Cross-workspace and cross-region metadata visibility.
> * Identity federation and unified principal management.

> [!WARNING]
> **Out of scope:**
> * Specific vendor pricing models.
> * Step-by-step UI tutorials for specific software versions.
> * Physical storage layer optimization (e.g., hardware-level tuning).

## Definitions
Provide precise definitions for key terms.

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Metastore | The top-level container for metadata, defining the boundary of a governance domain. |
| Catalog | A high-level grouping of data assets, often used as the primary unit of federation for a business unit. |
| Principal | An entity (user, service principal, or group) that can be granted permissions. |
| Privilege | A defined action (e.g., SELECT, CREATE, MANAGE) that can be performed on an object. |
| Securable Object | Any object in the catalog (table, volume, function) to which access can be granted. |
| Information Schema | A standard, read-only set of views providing metadata about the objects within a catalog. |
| Delegation | The process of assigning administrative rights of a specific sub-tree of the catalog to a domain owner. |

## Core Concepts
The foundation of Federated Governance with UC rests on the principle of **Distributed Ownership with Centralized Oversight**.

**1. Hierarchical Namespace**
UC provides a three-tier namespace (`catalog.schema.table`). In a federated model, the "Catalog" level is typically the boundary of autonomy. A central IT team manages the Metastore, while "Catalog Admin" rights are delegated to specific departments.

**2. Identity Federation**
For governance to be effective across a federation, identities must be consistent. This involves syncing a central Identity Provider (IdP) to the governance layer, ensuring that a user has the same identity regardless of which workspace or domain they are operating in.

**3. Policy Inheritance**
Permissions flow downward. A policy set at the Catalog level automatically applies to all Schemas and Tables within it unless explicitly overridden or refined. This allows central teams to set "Guardrails" at the top level while allowing domain teams to manage "Permissions" at the lower levels.

> [!TIP]
> Think of Federated Governance like a federal government system: the "Metastore" is the federal level (setting the constitution and laws), while "Catalogs" are states (managing their own resources and local rules within the federal framework).

## Standard Model
The standard model for Federated Governance involves a single, account-level Metastore that spans multiple environments (Development, Staging, Production) and business units.

*   **Central Governance Team:** Responsible for creating the Metastore, defining global tags, and managing top-level storage locations.
*   **Domain Owners:** Appointed as `CATALOG ADMINS`. They have full control over their assigned catalogs, including the ability to create schemas, manage tables, and grant access to other users within their domain.
*   **Data Consumers:** Users who access data across different catalogs based on the permissions granted by various Domain Owners, all through a single discovery interface.

## Common Patterns

**1. The Domain-Per-Catalog Pattern**
Each business unit (e.g., Finance, Marketing, R&D) is assigned its own Catalog. This is the most common pattern for organizations adopting a Data Mesh architecture.

**2. The Environment-Per-Catalog Pattern**
Separating `prod`, `dev`, and `test` into distinct catalogs within the same metastore to allow for unified lineage tracking while maintaining strict environment isolation.

**3. The Hub-and-Spoke Metadata Pattern**
A central "Gold" catalog contains certified, enterprise-wide datasets, while "Spoke" catalogs contain domain-specific experimental data.

## Anti-Patterns

**1. The "Super-User" Bottleneck**
Requiring a central admin to approve every single table creation or grant. This defeats the purpose of federation and slows down data democratization.

**2. Shadow Governance**
Business units creating their own independent Metastores or local catalogs that do not report to the central UC Metastore. This leads to "dark data" and compliance risks.

**3. Over-Privileging**
Granting `ACCOUNT ADMIN` or `METASTORE ADMIN` roles to domain users simply to bypass configuration hurdles.

> [!CAUTION]
> Avoid granting `ALL PRIVILEGES` at the Metastore level to non-security personnel. This collapses the federated model back into a high-risk centralized model where any user can compromise the entire organization's data integrity.

## Edge Cases

*   **Cross-Region Federation:** When data must reside in specific geographic regions due to sovereignty laws (e.g., GDPR), UC must manage metadata centrally while keeping the physical data localized.
*   **External Data Sharing:** Using protocols like Delta Sharing to federate governance with external partners who are not part of the internal identity provider.
*   **Legacy System Integration:** Handling "shallow" or "external" tables where UC manages the metadata, but the underlying data is still governed by legacy file-level permissions (IAM/ACLs).
