# 143. Root Cause Analysis Workflows

Canonical documentation for [143. Root Cause Analysis Workflows](Phase 6/143. Root Cause Analysis Workflows.md). This document defines concepts, terminology, and standard usage.

## Purpose
Root Cause Analysis (RCA) Workflows exist to provide a structured, repeatable methodology for identifying the underlying technical, process, or organizational failures that lead to an undesired outcome. The primary objective is to move beyond addressing immediate symptoms (proximate causes) and instead identify the fundamental "root" of the issue to prevent recurrence.

By standardizing these workflows, organizations ensure that post-incident investigations are objective, data-driven, and focused on systemic improvement rather than individual culpability.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is intended to be implementation-agnostic and authoritative, focusing on the logical progression of investigation rather than specific software tooling.

## Scope
This documentation covers the theoretical framework and procedural logic required to execute a comprehensive RCA.

> [!IMPORTANT]

## Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Root Cause | The fundamental, underlying reason for an event which, if removed, would prevent the event from recurring. |
| Proximate Cause | The event or condition that immediately preceded and directly resulted in the failure; often a symptom of the root cause. |
| Contributing Factor | A condition that influenced the outcome or increased the likelihood of the failure but was not the sole cause. |
| Corrective Action | A short-term action taken to eliminate a detected non-conformity or mitigate an active failure. |
| Preventive Action | A long-term systemic change designed to eliminate the cause of a potential non-conformity. |
| Blameless Post-Mortem | An investigation culture that focuses on systemic flaws rather than individual human error. |

## Core Concepts
The foundation of an effective RCA workflow rests on the transition from "Who did this?" to "Why did the system allow this to happen?"

**Causality vs. Correlation**
A critical concept in RCA is distinguishing between events that happened at the same time (correlation) and events where one directly triggered the other (causality). Workflows must mandate evidence-based links between steps in a failure chain.

**The Swiss Cheese Model**
Failures rarely result from a single point of failure. Instead, they occur when "holes" in multiple layers of defense (technical safeguards, process checks, organizational oversight) align simultaneously.

> [!TIP]
> Think of a system's defenses as slices of Swiss cheese stacked together. An incident only occurs when a "hole" (weakness) exists in every single slice, allowing a hazard to pass through the entire stack. RCA seeks to find and plug those holes.

## Standard Model
The standard RCA workflow follows a linear progression of logical phases:

1.  **Detection and Trigger:** The workflow begins once an incident is resolved or a threshold of "near-miss" events is met.
2.  **Data Collection:** Gathering all relevant telemetry, logs, timestamps, and stakeholder interviews. This creates a "Timeline of Events."
3.  **Causal Analysis:** Applying methodologies (see Common Patterns) to the timeline to identify the chain of events.
4.  **Identification of Root Cause(s):** Distilling the analysis into one or more fundamental systemic issues.
5.  **Remediation Planning:** Defining specific, measurable, and time-bound actions to address the root cause.
6.  **Verification:** A follow-up phase to ensure that the implemented changes actually mitigated the risk as intended.

## Common Patterns
Several established methodologies are used within the "Causal Analysis" phase of the workflow:

*   **The 5 Whys:** Iteratively asking "Why?" to peel away layers of symptoms. While simple, it is highly effective for straightforward technical failures.
*   **Ishikawa (Fishbone) Diagram:** A visualization tool that categorizes potential causes into themes such as Methods, Machines, People, Materials, Measurement, and Environment.
*   **Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA):** A proactive pattern where systems are analyzed for potential failure points before they occur, though often used post-incident to categorize the severity and frequency of the observed failure.
*   **Barrier Analysis:** Investigating which specific safeguards were in place to prevent the incident and why they failed to perform their function.

## Anti-Patterns
These practices undermine the integrity of the RCA and lead to "shallow" findings that do not prevent recurrence.

*   **The "Human Error" Trap:** Identifying a person's mistake as the root cause. Human error is a symptom of poor interface design, lack of training, or inadequate process controls.
*   **Confirmation Bias:** Starting the investigation with a preconceived notion of the cause and only seeking data that supports that theory.
*   **Root Cause Singularity:** Insisting there is only *one* root cause. Complex systems usually fail due to a combination of factors.
*   **Paperwork Compliance:** Completing the RCA workflow as a bureaucratic requirement rather than a learning opportunity, leading to "vague" remediation steps like "reminded staff to be careful."

> [!CAUTION]
> Avoid "Solution-First" thinking. Proposing a fix before the root cause is fully understood often leads to "Whack-a-Mole" engineering, where the fix for one symptom creates a new failure mode elsewhere.

## Edge Cases
*   **Transient/Non-Reproducible Issues ("Heisenbugs"):** When a failure occurs but cannot be replicated in a controlled environment. The workflow must rely on high-fidelity historical telemetry rather than live reproduction.
*   **Third-Party Dependencies:** When the root cause lies within a vendor's infrastructure. The RCA workflow must focus on "Blast Radius" mitigation and how the internal system should have handled the external failure (graceful degradation).
*   **Black Swan Events:** Extremely rare, high-impact events that were previously deemed impossible. The RCA should focus on resilience and adaptability rather than just preventing that specific, unlikely event.

## Related Topics
*   **Incident Management:** The precursor to RCA, focused on restoration of service.
*   **Observability and Telemetry:** The data source required for effective RCA workflows.
*   **Change Management:** The process through which RCA remediation actions are safely deployed.
*   **Chaos Engineering:** The practice of intentionally inducing failures to validate RCA-driven improvements.
