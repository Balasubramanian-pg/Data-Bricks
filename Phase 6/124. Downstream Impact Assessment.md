# 124. Downstream Impact Assessment

Canonical documentation for [124. Downstream Impact Assessment](Phase 6/124. Downstream Impact Assessment.md). This document defines concepts, terminology, and standard usage.

## Purpose
Downstream Impact Assessment (DIA) is a systematic process used to identify, evaluate, and mitigate the potential consequences that a change in a primary system, component, or data source may have on dependent entities. In complex, interconnected environments, a single modification can trigger a cascade of failures or behavioral shifts in systems that consume its output.

The primary goal of DIA is to ensure stability and predictability by transforming "unknown unknowns" into manageable risks. It addresses the problem of systemic fragility where changes are made in isolation without regard for the broader ecosystem.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is intended to be implementation-agnostic and authoritative, focusing on the architectural and procedural requirements of impact assessment rather than specific software tooling.

## Scope
This documentation covers the theoretical framework and operational standards for conducting impact assessments across technical and organizational boundaries.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **In scope:**
> * Dependency mapping and lineage analysis.
> * Risk quantification of proposed changes.
> * Communication protocols for downstream consumers.
> * Verification strategies for impact mitigation.

> [!WARNING]
> **Out of scope:**
> * Specific vendor implementations (e.g., specific cloud provider impact tools).
> * Project management timelines (e.g., Gantt charts for implementation).
> * Code-level debugging of specific regressions.

## Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Upstream | The source system, component, or process where a change originates. |
| Downstream | Any system, service, or stakeholder that consumes data, signals, or functionality from the upstream source. |
| Blast Radius | The total extent of potential disruption caused by a change, measured in terms of affected systems or users. |
| Dependency Mapping | The process of identifying all interconnected components and their directional relationships. |
| Transitive Dependency | An indirect relationship where System A affects System C because System A affects System B, and System B affects System C. |
| Contract | A formal or informal agreement (API spec, schema, SLA) defining the expected behavior of the upstream system. |

## Core Concepts
The fundamental principle of Downstream Impact Assessment is the recognition of the **Ripple Effect**. 

> [!TIP]
> Think of a Downstream Impact Assessment like a stone thrown into a pond. The "Upstream" is the point of impact, while the "Downstream" represents the concentric circles moving outward. An assessment must measure not just the splash, but how far the ripples travel and which shores they eventually hit.

### Dependency Directionality
Impact flows in the direction of consumption. While a downstream system depends on an upstream system for functionality, the upstream system bears the responsibility for the stability of that connection.

### Change Categorization
Not all changes require the same depth of assessment. DIA typically categorizes changes into:
1.  **Breaking Changes:** Alterations that violate existing contracts (e.g., removing a database field).
2.  **Non-Breaking Changes:** Additive or internal optimizations that preserve existing contracts.
3.  **Behavioral Changes:** Changes that do not break the contract but alter the logic or performance characteristics (e.g., a faster but less precise calculation).

## Standard Model
The standard model for a Downstream Impact Assessment follows a four-phase lifecycle:

1.  **Discovery (Inventory):** Identify all direct and transitive consumers of the component being changed. This often involves querying service registries, metadata catalogs, or dependency graphs.
2.  **Analysis (Evaluation):** Determine the nature of the impact. Will the downstream system fail, experience degraded performance, or require a manual update?
3.  **Communication (Notification):** Inform the owners of downstream systems. This includes providing a technical summary of the change, the expected timeline, and migration paths.
4.  **Verification (Validation):** Post-change testing to ensure that the actual impact aligns with the predicted impact and that no unforeseen regressions have occurred.

## Common Patterns
*   **Contract Testing:** Using automated suites to ensure that upstream changes do not violate the expectations of downstream consumers.
*   **Shadowing:** Running the new version of an upstream system in parallel with the old version to compare outputs before a full cutover.
*   **Versioned Releases:** Maintaining multiple versions of an upstream component (e.g., API v1 and v2) to allow downstream consumers to migrate at their own pace.
*   **Feature Flags:** Implementing toggles that allow for the immediate reversal of a change if a downstream impact is detected in production.

## Anti-Patterns
*   **The Silent Update:** Deploying changes to shared resources without notifying consumers, assuming "no one is using that field."
*   **Manual Lineage Tracking:** Relying on human memory or static spreadsheets to track dependencies in a dynamic environment.
*   **Shifting Responsibility:** Assuming that downstream consumers are solely responsible for monitoring their own stability when an upstream change occurs.
*   **Over-Assessment:** Treating trivial, internal refactors with the same level of rigor as breaking API changes, leading to "analysis paralysis."

> [!CAUTION]
> Avoid circular dependencies where System A is both upstream and downstream of System B. This creates an infinite feedback loop that makes impact assessment mathematically and operationally impossible.

## Edge Cases
*   **Hidden Dependencies (Shadow IT):** Systems that consume data or services through unofficial channels (e.g., screen scraping or direct database access) that are not captured in official dependency maps.
*   **Latent Impacts:** Changes that appear successful initially but cause downstream failures only under specific conditions, such as end-of-month processing or high-load events.
*   **Third-Party Egress:** When a change impacts an external partner or vendor whose internal systems are opaque to the assessing organization.
*   **Orphaned Downstreams:** Systems that are still running but have no active owner or maintainer to respond to impact notifications.

## Related Topics
*   **Change Management:** The broader organizational framework for controlling the lifecycle of changes.
*   **Data Lineage:** Specifically focused on the flow of data from origin to destination.
*   **Regression Testing:** The practice of verifying that existing functionality remains intact after a change.
*   **Observability and Monitoring:** The tools used to detect downstream failures in real-time.
