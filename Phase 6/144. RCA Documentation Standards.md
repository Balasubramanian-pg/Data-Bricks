# 144. RCA Documentation Standards

Canonical documentation for [144. RCA Documentation Standards](Phase 6/144. RCA Documentation Standards.md). This document defines concepts, terminology, and standard usage.

## Purpose
Root Cause Analysis (RCA) documentation serves as the formal record of an investigation into a system failure, performance degradation, or unexpected event. Its primary purpose is to facilitate systemic learning and prevent the recurrence of issues by identifying the underlying factors that allowed a failure to occur. 

This documentation transforms ephemeral incident data into institutional knowledge. It provides a structured framework for analyzing causality, ensuring that remediation efforts address fundamental systemic weaknesses rather than merely treating symptoms.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is intended to be implementation-agnostic and authoritative. It focuses on the structural and intellectual requirements of RCA records rather than the specific software used to host them.

## Scope
This standard defines the requirements for the content, structure, and analytical rigor of RCA documentation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **In scope:**
> * Structural components of an RCA report.
> * Standards for timeline construction and evidence preservation.
> * Methodologies for causal identification.
> * Requirements for actionable remediation items.

> [!WARNING]
> **Out of scope:**
> * Specific vendor implementations (e.g., Jira templates, ServiceNow modules).
> * Real-time incident response procedures.
> * Human Resources disciplinary processes.

## Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Root Cause | The fundamental, underlying reason for an event which, if removed, would prevent the recurrence of the issue. |
| Proximate Cause | The immediate event or condition that directly resulted in the failure; the "trigger." |
| Contributing Factor | A condition that influenced the effect by increasing its likelihood or accelerating the effect, but which alone would not have caused the event. |
| Causal Chain | The sequence of events and conditions that lead from the root cause to the final incident. |
| Remediation | Specific, measurable actions taken to address root causes and contributing factors. |
| Blame-Free Culture | An environment where documentation focuses on systemic flaws rather than individual human error. |

## Core Concepts

### The Swiss Cheese Model
To understand RCA documentation, one must view systems as multiple layers of defense. An incident occurs when the "holes" in these layers (weaknesses) align. Documentation must identify not just the final hole the failure passed through, but why the holes existed in every preceding layer.

> [!TIP]
> Think of a system failure like a house flood. The proximate cause is a burst pipe. The root cause might be a lack of winterization standards or a failure in the pressure-regulation valve design. Documentation that only records "the pipe burst" is incomplete.

### Causality vs. Correlation
Standardized documentation requires a strict distinction between events that happened at the same time (correlation) and events that directly led to the failure (causality). RCA records must provide evidence of a causal link to justify remediation efforts.

### The "Five Whys" and Beyond
While the "Five Whys" is a common starting point, authoritative documentation often requires more complex mapping (such as Fishbone or Fault Tree Analysis) to account for multi-causal failures in distributed systems.

## Standard Model
A standard RCA document must contain the following sections to be considered complete:

1.  **Executive Summary:** A high-level overview of what happened, the impact (duration and severity), and the primary resolution.
2.  **Incident Timeline:** A chronological list of events, including the first point of deviation, the moment of detection, and the final restoration of service.
3.  **Causal Analysis:** A detailed breakdown of the proximate cause, contributing factors, and the ultimate root cause(s).
4.  **Evidence/Data:** Links to or embeds of logs, metrics, screenshots, or configuration states that support the analysis.
5.  **Action Items (Remediation):** A list of specific tasks designed to prevent recurrence, categorized by priority and assigned to specific owners.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Every action item in an RCA must be directly linked to a finding in the Causal Analysis section.

## Common Patterns

### The Timeline-First Approach
Constructing a granular timeline is the most common pattern for initiating an RCA. By establishing a "source of truth" for the sequence of events, investigators can identify gaps in observability or delays in response.

### Barrier Analysis
This pattern focuses on identifying which safeguards were in place, which failed, and why they failed. It is particularly effective for documenting security breaches or safety incidents.

### Change-Linked Analysis
In modern software environments, a significant percentage of incidents are triggered by changes. This pattern focuses on the delta between the "last known good state" and the "failure state," documenting the deployment or configuration change that introduced the regression.

## Anti-Patterns

### Human Error as Root Cause
Labeling "human error" as a root cause is the most common documentation failure. Human error is a symptom of poor tooling, lack of training, or inadequate process design.

> [!CAUTION]
> Avoid concluding an RCA with "The engineer made a mistake." Instead, document why the system allowed the mistake to be catastrophic.

### Vague Action Items
Documentation that lists remediation steps like "Improve monitoring" or "Be more careful" is ineffective. Action items must be SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound).

### Post-Hoc Rationalization
This occurs when the documentation is written to support a pre-conceived notion of what went wrong, ignoring evidence that contradicts the initial theory.

## Edge Cases

### The "Heisenbug" (Non-Reproducible Events)
In cases where a root cause cannot be definitively proven due to a lack of data or the transient nature of the bug, the documentation must record the "Most Likely Causal Factor" while explicitly noting the uncertainty.

### Third-Party Failures
When the root cause lies within an external provider (e.g., an ISP or Cloud Vendor), the RCA documentation should focus on the internal system's "blast radius" and why the system was not resilient to the external failure.

### Multi-Causal Complex Systems
In microservices or distributed systems, there is rarely a single root cause. Documentation must account for "Emergent Behavior," where multiple healthy components interact in an unforeseen way to produce a failure.
