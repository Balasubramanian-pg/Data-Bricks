# Supported Languages Python SQL Scala R

Canonical documentation for Supported Languages Python SQL Scala R. This document defines concepts, terminology, and standard usage.

## Purpose

The purpose of this documentation is to provide a comprehensive overview of the supported programming languages, including Python, SQL, Scala, and R. These languages are widely used in various domains, such as data science, machine learning, and data analysis. The problem space addressed by this topic includes the need for a standardized set of languages that can be used for data processing, analysis, and visualization. By supporting these languages, developers and data scientists can leverage their strengths to build robust and efficient applications.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is intended to be implementation-agnostic and authoritative.

## Scope

The scope of this topic includes the concepts, terminology, and standard usage of the supported languages.

**In scope:**
* Language syntax and semantics
* Data types and structures
* Control structures and functions
* Integration with other languages and tools

**Out of scope:**
* Tool-specific implementations, such as IDEs or compilers
* Vendor-specific behavior, such as proprietary extensions or modifications
* Language-specific frameworks or libraries, unless they are widely adopted and standardized

## Definitions

The following definitions are used throughout this documentation:

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Python | A high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. |
| SQL | A standard language for managing relational databases, used for storing, manipulating, and querying data. |
| Scala | A multi-paradigm programming language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), known for its concise syntax and strong type system. |
| R | A programming language and environment for statistical computing and graphics, widely used in data analysis and machine learning. |
| Data type | A classification of data based on its format, size, and behavior, such as integer, string, or array. |
| Data structure | A way of organizing and storing data, such as arrays, lists, or trees. |

> [!TIP]
> Definitions should be stable over time; avoid contextual language.

## Core Concepts

The core concepts of the supported languages include:

### Programming Paradigms
The supported languages support various programming paradigms, such as:
* Imperative programming (Python, SQL)
* Object-oriented programming (Python, Scala)
* Functional programming (Scala, R)
* Declarative programming (SQL)

### Data Types and Structures
The supported languages have different data types and structures, such as:
* Primitive data types (Python, Scala)
* Composite data types (Python, R)
* Relational data structures (SQL)

### Control Structures and Functions
The supported languages have various control structures and functions, such as:
* Conditional statements (Python, Scala)
* Loops (Python, R)
* Functions (Python, Scala, R)
* Stored procedures (SQL)

## Standard Model

The standard model for the supported languages includes:

* Using Python for data analysis and machine learning tasks
* Using SQL for managing relational databases and performing queries
* Using Scala for building scalable and concurrent applications
* Using R for statistical computing and data visualization

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deviations from the standard model should be explicitly documented and justified.

## Common Patterns

Common patterns associated with the supported languages include:

* Using Python's pandas library for data manipulation and analysis
* Using SQL's JOIN clause for combining data from multiple tables
* Using Scala's Akka library for building concurrent and distributed systems
* Using R's ggplot2 library for data visualization

## Anti-Patterns

Common mistakes or discouraged practices include:

* Using Python's dynamic typing to avoid explicit type definitions
* Using SQL's SELECT \* clause to retrieve unnecessary data
* Using Scala's null values to represent missing data
* Using R's global variables to share data between functions

> [!WARNING]
> These anti-patterns often lead to maintenance or scalability issues.

## Edge Cases

Unusual, ambiguous, or boundary scenarios related to the supported languages include:

* Handling missing or null values in datasets
* Dealing with large datasets that exceed memory limits
* Integrating with other languages or systems that have different data types or structures

> [!CAUTION]
> Edge cases are frequently overlooked and may cause incorrect assumptions.
