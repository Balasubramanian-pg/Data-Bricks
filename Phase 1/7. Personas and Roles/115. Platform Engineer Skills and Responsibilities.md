Canonical documentation for Platform Engineer Skills and Responsibilities. This document defines concepts, terminology, and standard usage.

## Purpose

The role of a Platform Engineer is multifaceted, requiring a broad range of skills to design, implement, and maintain the underlying infrastructure and platforms that support an organization's applications and services. This topic exists to provide a comprehensive overview of the skills and responsibilities associated with the Platform Engineer role, addressing the problem space of ensuring that organizations have a clear understanding of the requirements and expectations for this critical position. The goal is to establish a common language and framework for discussing Platform Engineer skills and responsibilities, facilitating more effective communication and collaboration among stakeholders.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is intended to be implementation-agnostic and authoritative.

## Scope

The scope of this topic includes the skills and responsibilities associated with the Platform Engineer role, with a focus on the technical, operational, and collaborative aspects of the position.

**In scope:**
* Platform design and architecture

## Definitions

The following definitions are used throughout this documentation:

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Platform | A set of technologies, tools, and services that provide a foundation for building, deploying, and managing applications and services. |
| Infrastructure | The underlying systems, networks, and facilities that support the operation of an organization's applications and services. |
| Cloud Native | An approach to designing and building applications and services that take advantage of cloud computing principles and technologies. |
| DevOps | A set of practices and cultural philosophies that aim to improve collaboration and communication between development and operations teams. |
| Security | The practice of protecting an organization's assets, data, and systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. |

## Core Concepts

The following core concepts are fundamental to the Platform Engineer role:

### Platform Design and Architecture
The process of designing and building the underlying platforms that support an organization's applications and services, including the selection of technologies, tools, and services.

### Infrastructure Management and Maintenance
The ongoing process of managing and maintaining the underlying infrastructure that supports an organization's applications and services, including monitoring, troubleshooting, and optimizing performance.

### Cloud Computing and Migration
The process of designing, building, and migrating applications and services to cloud-based platforms, including the selection of cloud providers, services, and tools.

## Standard Model

The standard model for Platform Engineer skills and responsibilities includes the following key elements:

* Designing and building platforms that meet the needs of the organization and its stakeholders
* Managing and maintaining the underlying infrastructure that supports the platforms
* Ensuring the security, compliance, and reliability of the platforms and infrastructure
* Collaborating with development, operations, and other teams to ensure seamless integration and operation of the platforms and applications
* Continuously monitoring, evaluating, and improving the platforms and infrastructure to ensure they remain aligned with the organization's goals and objectives

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deviations from the standard model should be explicitly documented and justified.

## Common Patterns

The following common patterns are associated with the Platform Engineer role:

* Using cloud-native technologies and services to build and deploy applications and services
* Implementing DevOps practices and tools to improve collaboration and communication between development and operations teams
* Using containerization and orchestration technologies to manage and deploy applications and services
* Implementing security and compliance frameworks and controls to protect the organization's assets, data, and systems

## Anti-Patterns

The following anti-patterns are common mistakes or discouraged practices associated with the Platform Engineer role:

* Failing to design and build platforms that meet the needs of the organization and its stakeholders
* Neglecting to manage and maintain the underlying infrastructure that supports the platforms
* Ignoring security, compliance, and reliability considerations when designing and building platforms
* Failing to collaborate with development, operations, and other teams to ensure seamless integration and operation of the platforms and applications

> [!WARNING]
> These anti-patterns often lead to maintenance or scalability issues, and can have significant negative impacts on the organization and its stakeholders.

## Edge Cases

The following edge cases are unusual, ambiguous, or boundary scenarios related to the Platform Engineer role:

* Managing and maintaining legacy systems and infrastructure that are no longer supported or maintained by the vendor
* Integrating with third-party services or platforms that have unique or proprietary requirements
* Ensuring compliance with regulatory or industry-specific requirements that are not well-defined or are subject to change

> [!CAUTION]
> Edge cases are frequently overlooked and may cause incorrect assumptions or misunderstandings.
