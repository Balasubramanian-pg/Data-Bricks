## Core Concepts

Explain the fundamental ideas that make up the topic.

### Data Analysis Lifecycle
The data analysis lifecycle refers to the iterative process of defining problems, collecting and cleaning data, analyzing and modeling data, and communicating insights to stakeholders.

### Data-Driven Decision Making
Data-driven decision making is the practice of using data analysis and insights to inform business decisions, rather than relying on intuition or anecdotal evidence.

## Standard Model

Describe the generally accepted or recommended model for this topic.
