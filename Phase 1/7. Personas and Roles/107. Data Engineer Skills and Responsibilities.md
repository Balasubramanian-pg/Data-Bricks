# Data Engineer Skills and Responsibilities

Canonical documentation for Data Engineer Skills and Responsibilities. This document defines concepts, terminology, and standard usage.

## Purpose

The role of a Data Engineer is crucial in designing, building, and maintaining the architecture of an organization's data infrastructure. This topic exists to outline the necessary skills and responsibilities required for a Data Engineer to effectively manage and support the data ecosystem. The problem space it addresses includes the need for a standardized understanding of the Data Engineer role, the importance of data quality and integrity, and the requirement for scalable and efficient data systems. This documentation aims to provide a comprehensive guide for Data Engineers, data architects, and other stakeholders to ensure that data systems are designed and implemented to meet the needs of the organization.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is intended to be implementation-agnostic and authoritative.

## Scope

The scope of this topic includes the skills and responsibilities required for a Data Engineer to design, implement, and maintain data systems. The following concepts are in scope:

**In scope:**
* Data architecture and design
* Data storage and management
* Data processing and integration
* Data quality and governance
* Data security and compliance

**Out of scope:**
* Tool-specific implementations (e.g., Apache Hadoop, Amazon Web Services)
* Vendor-specific behavior (e.g., Oracle, Microsoft)
* Non-technical aspects of data management (e.g., data policy, data strategy)

## Definitions

The following terms are used throughout this documentation:

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Data Engineer | A professional responsible for designing, building, and maintaining the architecture of an organization's data infrastructure. |
| Data Architecture | The overall structure and organization of an organization's data assets, including data storage, processing, and integration. |
| Data Governance | The set of policies, procedures, and standards that ensure the quality, security, and compliance of an organization's data assets. |
| Data Quality | The degree to which data is accurate, complete, consistent, and reliable. |
| ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) | A process for extracting data from multiple sources, transforming it into a standardized format, and loading it into a target system. |

> [!TIP]
> Definitions should be stable over time; avoid contextual language.

## Core Concepts

The following core concepts are fundamental to the role of a Data Engineer:

### Data Architecture
A well-designed data architecture is critical to supporting the needs of the organization. This includes the design of data storage systems, data processing systems, and data integration systems.

### Data Governance
Data governance is essential to ensuring the quality, security, and compliance of an organization's data assets. This includes the development of data policies, data standards, and data procedures.

## Standard Model

The standard model for Data Engineer skills and responsibilities includes the following components:

1. Data architecture and design
2. Data storage and management
3. Data processing and integration
4. Data quality and governance
5. Data security and compliance

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deviations from the standard model should be explicitly documented and justified.

## Common Patterns

The following patterns are commonly associated with the role of a Data Engineer:

* Data warehousing and business intelligence
* Big data and NoSQL databases
* Cloud-based data platforms
* Data lakes and data hubs
* Real-time data processing and streaming

## Anti-Patterns

The following anti-patterns are common mistakes or discouraged practices in data engineering:

> [!WARNING]
> These anti-patterns often lead to maintenance or scalability issues.

* Insufficient data governance and quality control
* Inadequate data security and compliance
* Over-reliance on a single data storage or processing technology
* Lack of data architecture and design documentation
* Inadequate testing and validation of data systems

## Edge Cases

The following edge cases are unusual, ambiguous, or boundary scenarios related to data engineering:

> [!CAUTION]
> Edge cases are frequently overlooked and may cause incorrect assumptions.

* Handling sensitive or confidential data
* Integrating data from multiple, disparate sources
* Supporting real-time data processing and analytics
* Ensuring data compliance with regulatory requirements
* Managing data systems in a hybrid or multi-cloud environment
