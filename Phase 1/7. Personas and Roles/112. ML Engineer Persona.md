# ML Engineer Persona

Canonical documentation for ML Engineer Persona. This document defines concepts, terminology, and standard usage.

## Purpose

The ML Engineer Persona documentation exists to provide a comprehensive understanding of the skills, responsibilities, and best practices associated with the role of a Machine Learning Engineer. This topic addresses the problem space of defining the expectations, requirements, and competencies required for a professional to successfully design, develop, and deploy machine learning models and systems. The goal is to establish a shared understanding of the ML Engineer Persona, facilitating effective communication, collaboration, and knowledge sharing among stakeholders.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is intended to be implementation-agnostic and authoritative.

## Scope

**In scope:**
* Definition of the ML Engineer role and responsibilities
* Key skills and competencies required for the role
* Best practices for ML model development, deployment, and maintenance
* Collaboration and communication strategies for effective teamwork

**Out of scope:**
* Tool-specific implementations (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn)
* Vendor-specific behavior (e.g., cloud providers, hardware manufacturers)
* Detailed tutorials or step-by-step guides for specific tasks

## Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Machine Learning (ML) | A subset of artificial intelligence that involves training algorithms to learn from data and make predictions or decisions. |
| ML Engineer | A professional responsible for designing, developing, deploying, and maintaining machine learning models and systems. |
| Model Deployment | The process of integrating a trained ML model into a production-ready environment, making it available for use by end-users or other systems. |
| Model Maintenance | The ongoing process of monitoring, updating, and refining an ML model to ensure its performance, accuracy, and relevance over time. |

> [!TIP]
> Definitions should be stable over time; avoid contextual language.

## Core Concepts

### Machine Learning Fundamentals
A strong foundation in machine learning principles, including supervised and unsupervised learning, regression, classification, clustering, and neural networks.

### Data Preprocessing and Management
The ability to collect, preprocess, and manage large datasets, including data cleaning, feature engineering, and data visualization.

### Model Development and Evaluation
The skill to design, train, and evaluate ML models, including model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and performance metrics.

## Standard Model

The standard model for an ML Engineer Persona involves a combination of technical skills, business acumen, and collaboration. The recommended model includes:

1. **Technical Skills**: Proficiency in programming languages (e.g., Python, R), ML frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch), and data science tools (e.g., NumPy, pandas).
2. **Business Acumen**: Understanding of the business domain, industry trends, and organizational goals to ensure ML solutions align with business objectives.
3. **Collaboration**: Effective communication and teamwork skills to work with cross-functional teams, including data scientists, product managers, and engineers.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deviations from the standard model should be explicitly documented and justified.

## Common Patterns

* **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Using data and ML insights to inform business decisions and drive organizational outcomes.
* **Model Serving**: Deploying ML models as APIs or microservices to enable real-time predictions and decision-making.
* **Continuous Learning**: Staying up-to-date with industry developments, researching new techniques, and applying them to improve ML solutions.

## Anti-Patterns

> [!WARNING]
> These anti-patterns often lead to maintenance or scalability issues.

* **Over-Engineering**: Overly complex ML models or systems that are difficult to maintain, deploy, or scale.
* **Lack of Documentation**: Insufficient documentation of ML models, data, or code, leading to knowledge gaps and difficulties in maintenance or collaboration.
* **Inadequate Testing**: Inadequate testing or validation of ML models, resulting in poor performance, biases, or errors.

## Edge Cases

> [!CAUTION]
> Edge cases are frequently overlooked and may cause incorrect assumptions.

* **Data Quality Issues**: Handling missing, noisy, or biased data that can impact ML model performance or accuracy.
* **Model Drift**: Detecting and adapting to changes in data distributions or patterns that can affect ML model performance over time.
* **Explainability and Interpretability**: Providing insights into ML model decisions and predictions, particularly in high-stakes or regulated domains.

## Related Topics

* **Data Scientist Persona**: A related role that focuses on data analysis, visualization, and insights, often working closely with ML Engineers.
* **DevOps for ML**: The application of DevOps principles and practices to ML development, deployment, and maintenance.
