## Core Concepts

The following core concepts form the foundation of Compute Cost Optimization Basics:

### Concept One: Resource Utilization
Resource utilization refers to the extent to which allocated compute resources are being used. Understanding utilization patterns is crucial for optimizing compute costs, as underutilized resources can lead to wasted spending, while overutilization can result in performance degradation.

### Concept Two: Cost Modeling
Cost modeling involves creating a mathematical representation of the costs associated with compute resource utilization. Accurate cost models enable organizations to estimate and predict their compute costs, making it easier to identify areas for optimization.

## Standard Model

The standard model for Compute Cost Optimization Basics involves a iterative process of:

1. **Monitoring**: Collecting data on compute resource utilization and costs
2. **Analysis**: Identifying areas for optimization and creating cost models
3. **Optimization**: Adjusting compute resource allocation and utilization to minimize costs
4. **Verification**: Validating the effectiveness of optimization efforts and refining the process
