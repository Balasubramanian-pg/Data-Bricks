# Workspace UI Navigation

Canonical documentation for Workspace UI Navigation. This document defines concepts, terminology, and standard usage.

## Purpose

The Workspace UI Navigation topic exists to provide a comprehensive understanding of the principles, patterns, and best practices for navigating and interacting with workspace user interfaces. This documentation addresses the problem space of designing and implementing intuitive, efficient, and user-friendly navigation systems within workspace environments. The goal is to facilitate seamless user experiences, reduce cognitive load, and increase productivity. By establishing a common language and framework for workspace UI navigation, this documentation aims to promote consistency, usability, and accessibility across various applications and platforms.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is intended to be implementation-agnostic and authoritative.

## Scope

The scope of this topic includes the fundamental concepts, principles, and patterns related to workspace UI navigation. The following aspects are in scope:

**In scope:**
* Navigation menu structures and layouts
* Workspace panel management and organization
* User interface component interactions (e.g., buttons, icons, menus)
* Accessibility features and considerations

**Out of scope:**
* Tool-specific implementations (e.g., custom UI components, proprietary navigation systems)
* Vendor-specific behavior (e.g., unique features, platform-specific quirks)
* Low-level technical details (e.g., programming languages, API specifics)

## Definitions

The following terms are used throughout this documentation:

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Workspace | A digital environment where users interact with applications, tools, and data to perform tasks and achieve goals. |
| Navigation | The process of moving through and interacting with a workspace user interface to access features, functions, and information. |
| Panel | A self-contained section of the workspace UI that displays related information, tools, or features. |
| Component | A reusable UI element (e.g., button, icon, menu) that provides a specific functionality or interaction. |

> [!TIP]
> Definitions should be stable over time; avoid contextual language.

## Core Concepts

The fundamental ideas that make up workspace UI navigation include:

### Concept One: Navigation Menu Structures
A navigation menu structure refers to the organization and layout of menu items, submenus, and other navigational elements. Effective navigation menu structures should be intuitive, consistent, and scalable.

### Concept Two: Workspace Panel Management
Workspace panel management involves the organization, arrangement, and interaction of panels within the workspace UI. This includes features such as panel resizing, docking, and undocking.

## Standard Model

The standard model for workspace UI navigation recommends the following:

* A consistent navigation menu structure with clear and concise menu item labels
* A modular panel management system that allows users to customize their workspace layout
* Intuitive component interactions that follow established UI design patterns
* Accessibility features that enable users with disabilities to navigate and interact with the workspace UI

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deviations from the standard model should be explicitly documented and justified.

## Common Patterns

Recurring patterns and approaches associated with workspace UI navigation include:

* Using a primary navigation menu with secondary menus and submenus
* Implementing a panel docking system with customizable panel layouts
* Providing keyboard shortcuts and accessibility features for efficient navigation

* Pattern A: Using a breadcrumb navigation system to display the current location within the workspace
* Pattern B: Implementing a search function to facilitate quick access to specific features or information

## Anti-Patterns

Common mistakes or discouraged practices in workspace UI navigation include:

> [!WARNING]
> These anti-patterns often lead to maintenance or scalability issues.

* Anti-pattern A: Using a complex or deep navigation menu structure that can confuse users
* Anti-pattern B: Implementing a rigid panel management system that does not allow for user customization

## Edge Cases

Unusual, ambiguous, or boundary scenarios related to workspace UI navigation include:

> [!CAUTION]
> Edge cases are frequently overlooked and may cause incorrect assumptions.

* Users with disabilities who require specialized navigation assistance
* Internationalization and localization considerations for navigation menu structures and component interactions
* Handling unexpected user interactions or errors within the workspace UI
