# Workspace Administration Basics

Canonical documentation for Workspace Administration Basics. This document defines concepts, terminology, and standard usage.

## Purpose

Describe why this topic exists and what problem space it addresses. This section should be descriptive, not instructional.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is intended to be implementation-agnostic and authoritative.

Workspace Administration Basics exists to provide a foundational understanding of the principles, concepts, and best practices involved in managing and administering workspaces. The problem space it addresses includes the need for efficient, secure, and scalable workspace management, which is critical for organizations to collaborate, innovate, and achieve their goals. Effective workspace administration is essential for ensuring that workspaces are properly configured, maintained, and optimized to support the needs of users, teams, and the organization as a whole.

## Scope

Clarify what is in scope and out of scope for this topic.

**In scope:**
* Workspace configuration and setup
* User and group management
* Access control and permissions
* Workspace monitoring and maintenance

**Out of scope:**
* Tool-specific implementations (e.g., Microsoft Teams, Slack, Google Workspace)
* Vendor-specific behavior and customization
* Network and infrastructure administration

## Definitions

Provide precise definitions for key terms used throughout the documentation.

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Workspace | A virtual or physical environment where users collaborate, share resources, and perform tasks |
| Administrator | An individual or role responsible for managing and maintaining a workspace |
| User | An individual who interacts with a workspace to perform tasks or access resources |
| Role | A set of permissions and responsibilities assigned to a user or group within a workspace |

> [!TIP]
> Definitions should be stable over time; avoid contextual language.

## Core Concepts

Explain the fundamental ideas that make up the topic.

### Workspace Configuration
Workspace configuration refers to the process of setting up and customizing a workspace to meet the needs of users and the organization. This includes defining workspace structure, configuring access control and permissions, and setting up integrations with other tools and services.

### User and Group Management
User and group management involves creating, managing, and removing users and groups within a workspace. This includes assigning roles, permissions, and access control to ensure that users have the necessary privileges to perform their tasks.

## Standard Model

Describe the generally accepted or recommended model for this topic.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deviations from the standard model should be explicitly documented and justified.

The standard model for workspace administration involves a hierarchical structure, with administrators at the top, followed by users and groups. This model includes the following components:
* Workspace configuration and setup
* User and group management
* Access control and permissions
* Workspace monitoring and maintenance

## Common Patterns

Document recurring patterns or approaches associated with this topic.

* Centralized administration: A single administrator or team manages all workspaces within an organization.
* Decentralized administration: Multiple administrators or teams manage separate workspaces within an organization.
* Hybrid administration: A combination of centralized and decentralized administration, where some workspaces are managed centrally and others are managed locally.

## Anti-Patterns

Describe common mistakes or discouraged practices.

> [!WARNING]
> These anti-patterns often lead to maintenance or scalability issues.

* Overly complex workspace structure: Creating a workspace structure that is too complex or nested can lead to confusion and difficulties in management.
* Insufficient access control: Failing to implement proper access control and permissions can result in security vulnerabilities and data breaches.
* Lack of monitoring and maintenance: Neglecting to monitor and maintain workspaces can lead to performance issues, downtime, and data loss.

## Edge Cases

Explain unusual, ambiguous, or boundary scenarios related to the topic.

> [!CAUTION]
> Edge cases are frequently overlooked and may cause incorrect assumptions.

* Workspace migration: Migrating a workspace from one platform or tool to another can be a complex process that requires careful planning and execution.
* User and group synchronization: Synchronizing users and groups across multiple workspaces or platforms can be challenging, especially when dealing with different authentication mechanisms.
* Workspace consolidation: Consolidating multiple workspaces into a single workspace can be a complex process that requires careful planning and execution.
