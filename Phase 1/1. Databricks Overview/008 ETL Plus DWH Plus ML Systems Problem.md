## Definitions

The following terms are defined for use throughout this documentation:

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) | The process of extracting data from multiple sources, transforming it into a standardized format, and loading it into a target system, such as a data warehouse. |
| DWH (Data Warehousing) | A centralized repository that stores data from various sources in a single location, enabling business intelligence, reporting, and analytics. |
| ML (Machine Learning) | A subset of artificial intelligence that involves training algorithms to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. |
| Data Pipeline | A series of processes that extract, transform, and load data from source systems to target systems, such as data warehouses or data lakes. |
| Data Governance | The set of policies, procedures, and standards that ensure the quality, security, and compliance of an organization's data assets. |

## Core Concepts

The following core concepts are fundamental to understanding ETL Plus DWH Plus ML Systems:

### Concept One: Data Integration
Data integration refers to the process of combining data from multiple sources into a unified view, enabling organizations to gain insights and make informed decisions. This concept is critical in ETL Plus DWH Plus ML Systems, as it involves integrating data from various sources, transforming it into a standardized format, and loading it into a target system.

### Concept Two: Data Quality
Data quality is a critical aspect of ETL Plus DWH Plus ML Systems, as it directly impacts the accuracy and reliability of the insights generated by ML models. Data quality issues, such as missing or duplicate values, can significantly affect the performance of ML models and the overall effectiveness of the system.

## Standard Model

The standard model for ETL Plus DWH Plus ML Systems involves the following components:

1. **Data Ingestion**: Extracting data from various sources, such as databases, files, or APIs.
2. **Data Transformation**: Transforming the extracted data into a standardized format, using techniques such as data cleansing, data aggregation, and data normalization.
3. **Data Loading**: Loading the transformed data into a target system, such as a data warehouse or data lake.
4. **Data Warehousing**: Storing and managing the loaded data in a centralized repository, enabling business intelligence, reporting, and analytics.
5. **Machine Learning**: Developing and deploying ML models that operate on the data stored in the data warehouse, generating insights and predictions.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deviations from the standard model should be explicitly documented and justified.

## Common Patterns

The following patterns are commonly observed in ETL Plus DWH Plus ML Systems:

* **Data Pipeline Pattern**: Implementing a data pipeline to extract, transform, and load data from source systems to target systems.
* **Data Lake Pattern**: Using a data lake as a centralized repository for storing raw, unprocessed data, which can be processed and analyzed using various tools and techniques.

## Anti-Patterns

The following anti-patterns are commonly observed in ETL Plus DWH Plus ML Systems:

* **Data Silo Anti-Pattern**: Creating isolated data silos, where data is stored and processed in separate systems, leading to data duplication, inconsistencies, and integration challenges.
* **Data Quality Anti-Pattern**: Ignoring data quality issues, such as missing or duplicate values, which can significantly affect the performance of ML models and the overall effectiveness of the system.

> [!WARNING]
> These anti-patterns often lead to maintenance or scalability issues.

## Edge Cases

The following edge cases are commonly observed in ETL Plus DWH Plus ML Systems:

* **Handling Missing Data**: Developing strategies to handle missing data, such as imputing values or using machine learning algorithms that can handle missing data.
* **Handling Data Drift**: Developing strategies to handle data drift, such as monitoring data distributions and retraining ML models as necessary.

> [!CAUTION]
> Edge cases are frequently overlooked and may cause incorrect assumptions.
