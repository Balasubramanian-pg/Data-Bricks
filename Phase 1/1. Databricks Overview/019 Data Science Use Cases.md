## Definitions

Provide precise definitions for key terms used throughout the documentation.

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Data Science | The discipline of extracting insights and knowledge from data using various techniques, including machine learning, statistics, and data visualization. |
| Use Case | A specific application or scenario where data science is applied to drive business value or solve a problem. |
| Predictive Modeling | The process of using statistical and machine learning techniques to forecast future events or behaviors based on historical data. |
| Business Intelligence | The process of analyzing data to inform business decisions and drive strategic initiatives. |

> [!TIP]
> Definitions should be stable over time; avoid contextual language.

## Core Concepts

Explain the fundamental ideas that make up the topic.

### Data-Driven Decision Making
Data-driven decision making is the process of using data and analytics to inform business decisions, rather than relying on intuition or anecdotal evidence. This concept is central to Data Science Use Cases, as it enables organizations to make informed decisions that drive business value.

### Predictive Analytics
Predictive analytics is the use of statistical and machine learning techniques to forecast future events or behaviors based on historical data. This concept is critical to Data Science Use Cases, as it enables organizations to anticipate and prepare for future events.

## Standard Model

Describe the generally accepted or recommended model for this topic.

The standard model for Data Science Use Cases involves the following steps:

1. **Problem Definition**: Define the business problem or opportunity to be addressed.
2. **Data Collection**: Collect relevant data from various sources.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean, transform, and prepare the data for analysis.
4. **Modeling**: Apply machine learning or statistical techniques to the data to extract insights.
5. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the model and refine it as needed.
6. **Deployment**: Deploy the model in a production environment.
7. **Monitoring**: Monitor the performance of the model and update it as needed.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deviations from the standard model should be explicitly documented and justified.

## Common Patterns

Document recurring patterns or approaches associated with this topic.

* **Customer Segmentation**: Using clustering algorithms to segment customers based on demographic and behavioral characteristics.
* **Predictive Maintenance**: Using machine learning algorithms to predict equipment failures and schedule maintenance.
* **Recommendation Systems**: Using collaborative filtering or content-based filtering to recommend products or services to customers.

## Anti-Patterns

Describe common mistakes or discouraged practices.

> [!WARNING]
> These anti-patterns often lead to maintenance or scalability issues.

* **Data Hoarding**: Collecting and storing large amounts of data without a clear purpose or plan for analysis.
* **Model Overfitting**: Training a model on a small dataset, resulting in poor generalization to new data.
* **Lack of Interpretability**: Deploying a model without understanding how it makes predictions or decisions.

## Edge Cases

Explain unusual, ambiguous, or boundary scenarios related to the topic.

> [!CAUTION]
> Edge cases are frequently overlooked and may cause incorrect assumptions.

* **Handling Missing Data**: Dealing with missing or incomplete data in a dataset.
* **Class Imbalance**: Handling datasets with severely imbalanced class distributions.
* **Concept Drift**: Dealing with changes in the underlying data distribution over time.
