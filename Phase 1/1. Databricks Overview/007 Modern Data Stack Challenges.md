# Modern Data Stack Challenges

Canonical documentation for Modern Data Stack Challenges. This document defines concepts, terminology, and standard usage.

## Purpose

The Modern Data Stack Challenges topic exists to address the complexities and obstacles that organizations face when designing, implementing, and maintaining modern data stacks. The modern data stack is a critical component of any data-driven organization, and its challenges can have significant impacts on business outcomes, decision-making, and competitiveness. This topic aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the challenges associated with modern data stacks, including data integration, data quality, scalability, security, and governance. By understanding these challenges, organizations can better navigate the complexities of modern data stacks and make informed decisions about their data management strategies.

* Low-level technical details (e.g., network protocols, storage systems)

## Definitions

The following terms are used throughout this documentation:

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Data Stack | A set of technologies and tools used to collect, store, process, and analyze data |
| Data Integration | The process of combining data from multiple sources into a unified view |
| Data Quality | The degree to which data is accurate, complete, and consistent |
| Scalability | The ability of a system to handle increased load and demand |
| Governance | The set of policies, procedures, and standards for managing data |

> [!TIP]
> Definitions should be stable over time; avoid contextual language.

## Core Concepts

The Modern Data Stack Challenges topic is built around the following core concepts:

### Data Integration Challenges
Data integration is a critical component of modern data stacks, and it poses several challenges, including data format inconsistencies, schema mismatches, and data quality issues. Integrating data from multiple sources requires careful planning, execution, and maintenance to ensure that data is accurate, complete, and consistent.

### Data Quality Challenges
Data quality is a major concern in modern data stacks, as poor data quality can lead to incorrect insights, bad decision-making, and reputational damage. Data quality challenges include data inconsistencies, data duplicates, and data anomalies, which can be caused by human error, system errors, or data integration issues.

## Standard Model

The standard model for modern data stacks includes the following components:

1. Data Ingestion: Collecting data from multiple sources
2. Data Processing: Transforming and processing data for analysis
3. Data Storage: Storing data in a scalable and secure manner
4. Data Analytics: Analyzing data to gain insights and make decisions
5. Data Governance: Managing data quality, security, and compliance

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deviations from the standard model should be explicitly documented and justified.

## Common Patterns

The following patterns are commonly associated with modern data stacks:

* Data Lake Architecture: Storing raw, unprocessed data in a centralized repository
* Data Warehouse Architecture: Storing processed, aggregated data in a centralized repository
* Cloud-Native Architecture: Building data stacks using cloud-based services and tools
* Hybrid Architecture: Combining on-premises and cloud-based data stacks

## Anti-Patterns

The following anti-patterns are commonly associated with modern data stacks:

> [!WARNING]
> These anti-patterns often lead to maintenance or scalability issues.

* Data Silos: Storing data in isolated, disconnected systems
* Data Duplication: Storing duplicate copies of data in multiple systems
* Lack of Data Governance: Failing to establish policies, procedures, and standards for managing data
* Insufficient Data Security: Failing to implement adequate security measures to protect data

## Edge Cases

The following edge cases are associated with modern data stacks:

> [!CAUTION]
> Edge cases are frequently overlooked and may cause incorrect assumptions.

* Handling sensitive or regulated data (e.g., PII, HIPAA)
* Managing data from IoT devices or real-time data streams
* Integrating data from legacy systems or mainframes
* Supporting multiple data formats or protocols
