# Real Time Analytics Use Cases

Canonical documentation for Real Time Analytics Use Cases. This document defines concepts, terminology, and standard usage.

## Purpose

Real-time analytics use cases exist to address the need for immediate insights and decision-making in various industries and applications. The problem space it addresses involves the inability to process and analyze large volumes of data in a timely manner, resulting in delayed decision-making and potential loss of opportunities. Real-time analytics use cases aim to provide instantaneous analysis and visualization of data, enabling organizations to respond quickly to changing conditions, optimize operations, and improve customer experiences. This documentation is intended to be implementation-agnostic and authoritative, providing a comprehensive guide to real-time analytics use cases.

## Definitions

The following terms are used throughout this documentation:

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Real-time analytics | The process of analyzing and visualizing data as it is generated, typically in a matter of milliseconds or seconds. |
| Event-driven analytics | The analysis of data generated by specific events or actions, such as user interactions or sensor readings. |
| Stream processing | The processing of continuous streams of data, often using distributed computing systems. |
| Real-time data visualization | The presentation of data in a graphical or visual format, updated in real-time to reflect changing conditions. |

> [!TIP]
> Definitions should be stable over time; avoid contextual language.

## Core Concepts

The core concepts of real-time analytics use cases include:

### Event-Driven Architecture
An event-driven architecture is a design pattern that focuses on producing, processing, and reacting to events. In real-time analytics, events are used to trigger analysis and decision-making.

### Stream Processing
Stream processing is a key concept in real-time analytics, as it enables the processing of continuous streams of data. This can be achieved using distributed computing systems, such as Apache Kafka or Apache Flink.

### Real-Time Data Visualization
Real-time data visualization is critical in real-time analytics, as it enables users to quickly understand and respond to changing conditions. This can be achieved using various visualization tools and techniques, such as dashboards, charts, and graphs.

## Standard Model

The standard model for real-time analytics use cases involves the following components:

1. **Data Ingestion**: Collecting and processing data from various sources, such as sensors, logs, or user interactions.
2. **Stream Processing**: Processing the ingested data in real-time, using distributed computing systems and event-driven architectures.
3. **Real-Time Analytics**: Analyzing the processed data in real-time, using various algorithms and techniques, such as machine learning or statistical analysis.
4. **Real-Time Data Visualization**: Presenting the analyzed data in a graphical or visual format, updated in real-time to reflect changing conditions.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deviations from the standard model should be explicitly documented and justified.

## Common Patterns

Common patterns in real-time analytics use cases include:

* **IoT Sensor Analytics**: Analyzing data from IoT sensors to monitor and optimize industrial equipment, vehicles, or other devices.
* **Real-Time Customer Analytics**: Analyzing customer interactions and behavior to personalize marketing, improve customer experience, and optimize sales.
* **Financial Transaction Analytics**: Analyzing financial transactions in real-time to detect fraud, optimize trading, and manage risk.

## Anti-Patterns

Anti-patterns in real-time analytics use cases include:

> [!WARNING]
> These anti-patterns often lead to maintenance or scalability issues.

* **Batch Processing**: Processing data in batches, rather than in real-time, can lead to delayed decision-making and missed opportunities.
* **Over-Engineering**: Over-engineering real-time analytics systems can lead to complexity, scalability issues, and increased maintenance costs.
* **Lack of Data Quality**: Failing to ensure data quality can lead to inaccurate analysis, poor decision-making, and decreased trust in the analytics system.

## Edge Cases

Edge cases in real-time analytics use cases include:

> [!CAUTION]
> Edge cases are frequently overlooked and may cause incorrect assumptions.

* **Handling Missing or Duplicate Data**: Handling missing or duplicate data in real-time analytics systems can be challenging, and requires careful consideration of data quality and processing algorithms.
* **Dealing with High-Volume or High-Velocity Data**: Dealing with high-volume or high-velocity data can be challenging, and requires careful consideration of scalability, performance, and resource allocation.
* **Integrating with Legacy Systems**: Integrating real-time analytics systems with legacy systems can be challenging, and requires careful consideration of data formats, protocols, and compatibility issues.
