# Readme

Canonical documentation for Readme. This document defines concepts, terminology, and standard usage.

## Purpose

The Readme topic exists to provide a centralized location for essential information about a project, product, or repository. It addresses the problem space of discovery, onboarding, and understanding the purpose, functionality, and usage of a given entity. The Readme serves as a crucial entry point for users, developers, and maintainers, offering a concise and informative overview of the project's scope, features, and requirements. By standardizing the content and structure of Readme files, this documentation aims to improve the overall user experience, reduce confusion, and facilitate collaboration.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is intended to be implementation-agnostic and authoritative.

## Scope

**In scope:**
* Readme file structure and content guidelines
* Best practices for writing and maintaining Readme files
* Standardized terminology and formatting conventions

**Out of scope:**
* Tool-specific implementations (e.g., GitHub Flavored Markdown, Bitbucket Markdown)
* Vendor-specific behavior (e.g., GitHub Pages, GitLab Wiki)
* Project-specific details (e.g., licensing, contributors, changelogs)

## Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Readme | A text file containing essential information about a project, product, or repository, typically located in the root directory. |
| Markdown | A lightweight markup language used for formatting plain text, commonly used in Readme files. |
| Project | A set of related files, directories, and resources, often hosted in a version control system. |

> [!TIP]
> Definitions should be stable over time; avoid contextual language.

## Core Concepts

### Introduction
The introduction section provides a brief overview of the project, including its purpose, goals, and target audience.

### Getting Started
The getting started section offers step-by-step instructions for setting up and using the project, including any necessary dependencies or prerequisites.

### Features and Functionality
The features and functionality section describes the project's capabilities, including any notable features, APIs, or interfaces.

## Standard Model

The standard model for a Readme file consists of the following sections:
1. Introduction
2. Getting Started
3. Features and Functionality
4. Contributing
5. License
6. Acknowledgments

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deviations from the standard model should be explicitly documented and justified.

## Common Patterns

* Using a table of contents to facilitate navigation
* Including screenshots or diagrams to illustrate key concepts
* Providing a list of frequently asked questions (FAQs) or troubleshooting tips

## Anti-Patterns

> [!WARNING]
> These anti-patterns often lead to maintenance or scalability issues.

* Including excessive or unnecessary information, making the Readme file overly long or cumbersome
* Failing to update the Readme file to reflect changes in the project or its dependencies
* Using ambiguous or unclear language, leading to confusion among users or contributors

## Edge Cases

> [!CAUTION]
> Edge cases are frequently overlooked and may cause incorrect assumptions.

* Handling multiple Readme files in a single repository (e.g., for subprojects or modules)
* Supporting multiple languages or localization in a single Readme file
* Dealing with conflicting or outdated information in the Readme file

## Related Topics

* Documentation guidelines
* Project management best practices
* Version control systems (e.g., Git, Mercurial)
