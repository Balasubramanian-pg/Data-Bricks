# Databricks Mastery Roadmap

A structured path from absolute beginner to production-grade practitioner

## Guiding Philosophy

Databricks is not “Spark with a UI”. It is an entire data and AI operating system built around the Lakehouse architecture. The smartest way to learn it is to treat it like an ecosystem. Every skill you pick up will make more sense when you understand how it fits into the full stack.

The goal is to start from fundamentals and move all the way to real-world engineering patterns, optimisation, governance and AI workloads.

# Phase 1: Foundation and Onboarding

**The What, Why and Basic Hands-On Familiarity**

### Objectives

Understand why Databricks exists, how the Lakehouse simplifies the modern data stack, and get your first working environment.

### Concepts to Master

**1. Databricks Overview**

* History and relation to Apache Spark
* Shift from ETL + DWH + ML systems to a unified platform
* Open standards: Delta Lake, MLflow, Unity Catalog

**2. Lakehouse Paradigm**

* Separation of storage and compute
* Batch and streaming on one architecture
* Governed tables, ACID transactions, schema enforcement
* Why Lakehouse removes the need for separate data lakes and warehouses

**3. Core Components**

* Workspace basics
* Clusters vs SQL Warehouses
* Notebooks
* Repos
* Jobs (high level)

**4. Personas**
Understand what each role does and which skills align with your goals:

* Data Engineer
* Data Scientist
* Data Analyst
* ML Engineer
* Platform Engineer

### Action Steps

1. Read “What is Databricks?” official guide.
2. Create a free Databricks Community Edition workspace.
3. Launch your first cluster.
4. Run a basic Spark notebook (DataFrame creation, transformations).
5. Explore the UI: workspace browser, data browser, compute tab.
6. Import and run a sample notebook from Databricks examples gallery.
