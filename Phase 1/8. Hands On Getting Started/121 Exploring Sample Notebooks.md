## Definitions

The following terms are used throughout this documentation:

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Sample Notebook | A pre-built notebook containing example code, data, and visualizations to demonstrate a specific concept or workflow |
| Notebook Template | A pre-defined notebook structure and content used as a starting point for new projects |
| Code Cell | A single unit of executable code within a notebook |
| Markdown Cell | A cell containing formatted text used for documentation and explanation |

> [!TIP]
> Definitions should be stable over time; avoid contextual language.

## Core Concepts

The core concepts of Exploring Sample Notebooks include:

### Sample Notebook Structure
A well-organized sample notebook typically consists of a clear introduction, step-by-step instructions, and example code cells that demonstrate key concepts. The notebook structure should be logical, easy to follow, and include relevant markdown cells for explanation and context.

### Code Reuse and Adaptation
Effective exploration of sample notebooks involves reusing and adapting existing code to fit specific use cases. This requires understanding the underlying concepts, identifying relevant code cells, and modifying them to suit the user's needs.

## Standard Model

The standard model for Exploring Sample Notebooks involves the following steps:

1. **Discovery**: Identify relevant sample notebooks through search, recommendations, or community feedback.
2. **Exploration**: Open and navigate the sample notebook, reading markdown cells and executing code cells to understand the content.
3. **Adaptation**: Modify the sample notebook code to fit the user's specific use case, using techniques such as code reuse, refactoring, and extension.
4. **Validation**: Verify that the adapted code produces the expected results, using techniques such as testing, debugging, and visualization.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deviations from the standard model should be explicitly documented and justified.

## Common Patterns

Common patterns associated with Exploring Sample Notebooks include:

* **Template-based development**: Using sample notebooks as templates for new projects, adapting the structure and code to fit specific requirements.
* **Code snippet reuse**: Extracting and reusing individual code cells or snippets from sample notebooks to accelerate development.

## Anti-Patterns

Anti-patterns to avoid when Exploring Sample Notebooks include:

> [!WARNING]
> These anti-patterns often lead to maintenance or scalability issues.

* **Over-reliance on sample code**: Failing to understand the underlying concepts and simply copying code without adaptation or validation.
* **Insufficient documentation**: Not documenting changes, adaptations, or modifications made to the sample notebook code, leading to maintainability issues.

## Edge Cases

Edge cases to consider when Exploring Sample Notebooks include:

> [!CAUTION]
> Edge cases are frequently overlooked and may cause incorrect assumptions.

* **Version compatibility**: Ensuring that the sample notebook code is compatible with the user's specific version of the notebook software or dependencies.
* **Data dependencies**: Understanding and managing data dependencies, such as dataset versions, formats, or storage locations, when adapting sample notebook code.
