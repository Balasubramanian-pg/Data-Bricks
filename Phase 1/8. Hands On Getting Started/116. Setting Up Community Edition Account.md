## Core Concepts

### Account Creation
The process of creating a new account, including providing required information such as username, email address, and password.

### Account Verification
The process of validating a user's email address or other identifying information to ensure account security and prevent spam or abuse.

## Standard Model

The standard model for setting up a Community Edition account involves the following steps:

1. Registration: The user provides required information and agrees to terms of service.
2. Account Creation: The system creates a new account and generates a unique identifier.
3. Account Verification: The user verifies their email address or other identifying information.
4. Account Setup: The user configures their account settings, including password, profile information, and notification preferences.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deviations from the standard model should be explicitly documented and justified.

## Common Patterns

* Using a username and password for account authentication
* Providing a valid email address for account verification and communication
* Configuring account settings, such as notification preferences and profile information

## Anti-Patterns

> [!WARNING]
> These anti-patterns often lead to maintenance or scalability issues.

* Using weak or easily guessable passwords
* Providing false or misleading information during registration
* Failing to verify account email addresses or other identifying information

## Edge Cases

> [!CAUTION]
> Edge cases are frequently overlooked and may cause incorrect assumptions.
