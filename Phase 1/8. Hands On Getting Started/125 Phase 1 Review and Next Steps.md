# Phase 1 Review and Next Steps

Canonical documentation for Phase 1 Review and Next Steps. This document defines concepts, terminology, and standard usage.

## Purpose

The Phase 1 Review and Next Steps topic exists to provide a structured approach to evaluating the initial phase of a project or initiative, identifying key outcomes, and determining the subsequent steps to ensure successful progression. This topic addresses the problem space of inconsistent or inadequate review processes, which can lead to project delays, scope creep, or failure to meet objectives. By establishing a clear and standardized review framework, stakeholders can ensure that projects are properly assessed, and necessary adjustments are made to achieve desired outcomes.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is intended to be implementation-agnostic and authoritative.

## Scope

The scope of this topic includes the concepts, processes, and best practices related to reviewing the initial phase of a project or initiative and determining next steps.

**In scope:**
* Project initiation and planning
* Phase 1 review criteria and methodology
* Identification of key outcomes and lessons learned
* Determination of next steps and project progression

**Out of scope:**
* Tool-specific implementations (e.g., project management software)
* Vendor-specific behavior (e.g., proprietary review methodologies)
* Detailed project planning and execution (covered in separate topics)

## Definitions

The following terms are used throughout this documentation:

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Phase 1 Review | A structured evaluation of the initial phase of a project or initiative, focusing on key outcomes, lessons learned, and determination of next steps. |
| Next Steps | The subsequent actions or decisions resulting from the Phase 1 Review, aimed at ensuring project progression and success. |
| Project Initiation | The process of defining, planning, and launching a project or initiative. |
| Review Criteria | The standards or benchmarks used to evaluate the success and outcomes of the initial phase of a project or initiative. |

> [!TIP]
> Definitions should be stable over time; avoid contextual language.

## Core Concepts

The fundamental ideas that make up the Phase 1 Review and Next Steps topic include:

### Project Initiation and Planning
The process of defining, planning, and launching a project or initiative, including setting clear objectives, scope, and timelines.

### Phase 1 Review Methodology
A structured approach to evaluating the initial phase of a project or initiative, focusing on key outcomes, lessons learned, and determination of next steps.

### Next Steps Determination
The process of identifying and prioritizing subsequent actions or decisions resulting from the Phase 1 Review, aimed at ensuring project progression and success.

## Standard Model

The standard model for Phase 1 Review and Next Steps involves the following steps:

1. **Project Initiation**: Define, plan, and launch the project or initiative.
2. **Phase 1 Execution**: Complete the initial phase of the project or initiative.
3. **Phase 1 Review**: Conduct a structured evaluation of the initial phase, focusing on key outcomes, lessons learned, and determination of next steps.
4. **Next Steps Determination**: Identify and prioritize subsequent actions or decisions resulting from the Phase 1 Review.
5. **Project Progression**: Implement the determined next steps, ensuring project progression and success.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deviations from the standard model should be explicitly documented and justified.

## Common Patterns

Recurring patterns or approaches associated with Phase 1 Review and Next Steps include:

* **Gate Review**: A formal review process at the end of each project phase, used to evaluate progress and determine next steps.
* **Lessons Learned**: A process of capturing and documenting knowledge and experiences gained during the project, used to improve future projects and initiatives.

## Anti-Patterns

Common mistakes or discouraged practices in Phase 1 Review and Next Steps include:

* **Insufficient Review**: Failing to conduct a thorough and structured review of the initial phase, leading to inadequate identification of key outcomes and lessons learned.
* **Lack of Clear Next Steps**: Failing to clearly define and prioritize subsequent actions or decisions, leading to project delays or stagnation.

> [!WARNING]
> These anti-patterns often lead to maintenance or scalability issues, and can negatively impact project success.

## Edge Cases

Unusual, ambiguous, or boundary scenarios related to Phase 1 Review and Next Steps include:

* **Project Scope Changes**: Significant changes to the project scope during the initial phase, requiring adjustments to the review criteria and next steps.
* **Stakeholder Conflicts**: Conflicts or disagreements among stakeholders regarding the project's objectives, scope, or next steps.

> [!CAUTION]
> Edge cases are frequently overlooked and may cause incorrect assumptions, leading to project delays or failure.
