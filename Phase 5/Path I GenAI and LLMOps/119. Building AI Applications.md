## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of building AI applications include data quality, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, model evaluation, and deployment. Data quality is critical, as AI models are only as good as the data they are trained on. Model selection involves choosing the most suitable algorithm for the problem at hand, while hyperparameter tuning involves optimizing the model's parameters for better performance. Model evaluation involves assessing the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. Deployment involves integrating the trained model into a production-ready application.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for building AI applications involves a structured approach, including:
1. Problem definition and requirements gathering
2. Data collection and preprocessing
3. Model selection and training
4. Model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning
5. Deployment and monitoring
This model provides a foundation for building AI applications, ensuring that all critical steps are considered and addressed.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in building AI applications include:
* Using transfer learning to leverage pre-trained models
* Implementing data augmentation to increase dataset size and diversity
