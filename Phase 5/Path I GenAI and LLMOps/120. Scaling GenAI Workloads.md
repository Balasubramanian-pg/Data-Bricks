## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of scaling GenAI workloads include:
- **Distributed Architecture**: Designing systems to distribute workload across multiple nodes or instances to improve scalability and reliability.
- **Autoscaling**: Dynamically adjusting the number of nodes or instances based on workload demand to optimize resource utilization.
- **Load Balancing**: Distributing incoming traffic across multiple nodes or instances to ensure efficient use of resources and minimize latency.
- **Caching and Buffering**: Implementing caching and buffering mechanisms to reduce the load on GenAI systems and improve response times.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for scaling GenAI workloads involves a multi-layered approach:
1. **Data Ingestion Layer**: Handling and processing incoming data through distributed and parallel processing techniques.
2. **Processing Layer**: Utilizing distributed computing and parallel processing to execute GenAI workloads efficiently.
3. **Storage Layer**: Implementing scalable storage solutions to handle large volumes of data.
4. **Retrieval Layer**: Optimizing data retrieval mechanisms to minimize latency and improve overall system performance.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in scaling GenAI workloads include:
- **Microservices Architecture**: Breaking down the system into smaller, independent services that can be scaled individually.
- **Containerization**: Using containers to package and deploy GenAI applications for improved scalability and portability.
- **Serverless Computing**: Leveraging serverless architectures to dynamically allocate resources based on workload demand.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in scaling GenAI workloads include:
- **Over-Provisioning**: Allocating more resources than necessary, leading to wasted capacity and increased costs.
- **Under-Provisioning**: Allocating insufficient resources, resulting in performance degradation and increased latency.
- **Monolithic Architecture**: Designing systems as a single, monolithic block, which can limit scalability and flexibility.
