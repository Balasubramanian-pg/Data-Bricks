Canonical documentation for 124. Error Recovery and Replay. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 124. Error Recovery and Replay exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of Error Recovery and Replay is to provide a mechanism for handling and recovering from errors that occur during the execution of a process or system, ensuring data consistency and integrity. The problem space includes scenarios where errors can cause data loss, corruption, or inconsistencies, and where replaying a sequence of operations is necessary to restore a previous state or to reattempt a failed operation.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Error Recovery and Replay involves detecting errors, logging relevant information, and replaying a sequence of operations to restore a previous state or to reattempt a failed operation. This process ensures that the system remains in a consistent state, even in the presence of errors, and provides a mechanism for recovering from failures.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Error | An unexpected event or condition that occurs during the execution of a process or system. |
| Recovery | The process of restoring a system or process to a previous state after an error has occurred. |
| Replay | The process of reexecuting a sequence of operations to restore a previous state or to reattempt a failed operation. |
| Checkpoint | A point in time where the state of a system or process is saved, allowing for recovery to that point in case of an error. |
| Log | A record of events or transactions that have occurred during the execution of a process or system. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Error Recovery and Replay include:
* Error detection: identifying when an error has occurred
* Logging: recording relevant information about the error
* Checkpointing: saving the state of a system or process at regular intervals
* Recovery: restoring a system or process to a previous state after an error has occurred
* Replay: reexecuting a sequence of operations to restore a previous state or to reattempt a failed operation

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Error Recovery and Replay involves the following steps:
1. Error detection: identify when an error has occurred
2. Logging: record relevant information about the error
3. Checkpointing: restore the system or process to a previous checkpoint
4. Replay: reexecute the sequence of operations that led to the error
5. Verification: verify that the system or process is in a consistent state

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for Error Recovery and Replay include:
* Periodic checkpointing: saving the state of a system or process at regular intervals
* Transactional logging: recording all transactions or operations that occur during the execution of a process or system
* Idempotent operations: designing operations to be idempotent, so that replaying them multiple times has the same effect as executing them once

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for Error Recovery and Replay include:
* Not logging errors or relevant information
* Not checkpointing regularly
* Not designing operations to be idempotent
* Not verifying the consistency of a system or process after recovery
