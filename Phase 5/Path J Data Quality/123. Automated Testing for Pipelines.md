# 123. Automated Testing for Pipelines

Canonical documentation for 123. Automated Testing for Pipelines. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 123. Automated Testing for Pipelines exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Automated testing for pipelines is crucial for ensuring the reliability, stability, and efficiency of software delivery pipelines. The primary purpose of automated testing for pipelines is to validate the correctness and integrity of the pipeline's components, such as build, deployment, and release processes. This addresses the class of problems related to manual testing, which can be time-consuming, prone to human error, and often incomplete. Automated testing for pipelines helps to identify defects early in the development cycle, reducing the overall cost and time required to deliver software.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of automated testing for pipelines involves a series of automated tests that validate the pipeline's functionality, performance, and security. These tests are typically integrated into the pipeline itself, allowing for continuous testing and feedback. The pipeline is divided into stages, each with its own set of tests, ensuring that defects are caught and addressed at the earliest possible stage. This high-level model consists of the following components: test planning, test development, test execution, and test reporting.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Pipeline | A series of automated processes that facilitate software delivery, from build to deployment. |
| Automated Testing | The use of software to execute tests, reducing the need for manual testing. |
| Test Stage | A specific point in the pipeline where tests are executed. |
| Test Suite | A collection of tests designed to validate a specific aspect of the pipeline. |
| Continuous Testing | The practice of integrating automated testing into the pipeline, providing continuous feedback. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of automated testing for pipelines include: (1) **Test Automation**, which involves using software to execute tests; (2) **Continuous Integration**, which integrates code changes into a central repository; (3) **Continuous Delivery**, which ensures that software is always in a releasable state; and (4) **Test-Driven Development**, which involves writing tests before writing code. These concepts form the foundation of automated testing for pipelines, enabling teams to deliver high-quality software quickly and reliably.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for automated testing for pipelines typically involves the following stages: (1) **Build**, where code is compiled and packaged; (2) **Unit Testing**, where individual components are tested; (3) **Integration Testing**, where components are tested together; (4) **Deployment**, where software is deployed to a production-like environment; and (5) **Release**, where software is made available to end-users. Each stage has its own set of automated tests, ensuring that defects are caught and addressed early in the pipeline.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in automated testing for pipelines include: (1) **Shift-Left Testing**, where testing is integrated into the development process; (2) **Test-Driven Development**, where tests are written before code; (3) **Behavior-Driven Development**, where tests are written in a natural language style; and (4) **Infrastructure as Code**, where infrastructure is managed through code. These patterns help teams to deliver high-quality software quickly and reliably, while also reducing the risk of defects and downtime.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in automated testing for pipelines include: (1) **Manual Testing**, where tests are executed manually; (2) **Test-Last Development**, where testing is done after code is written; (3) **Over-Testing**, where too many tests are written, leading to maintenance issues; and (4) **Under-Testing**, where too few tests are written, leading to defects in production. These anti-patterns can lead to delays, defects, and increased costs, and should be avoided in favor of more effective and efficient testing practices.
