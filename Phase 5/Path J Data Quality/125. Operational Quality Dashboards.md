# 125. Operational Quality Dashboards

Canonical documentation for 125. Operational Quality Dashboards. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 125. Operational Quality Dashboards exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of Operational Quality Dashboards is to provide a centralized platform for monitoring, analyzing, and improving the quality of operational processes within an organization. The problem space addressed by Operational Quality Dashboards includes the lack of visibility into operational performance, inability to identify areas for improvement, and limited capacity for data-driven decision-making. By providing a unified view of operational quality metrics, these dashboards enable organizations to optimize their processes, reduce errors, and enhance overall efficiency.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Operational Quality Dashboards are designed to integrate data from various sources, such as production systems, quality control systems, and customer feedback platforms. This integrated data is then visualized through interactive and customizable dashboards, allowing users to track key performance indicators (KPIs), identify trends, and detect anomalies. The dashboards typically include features such as real-time monitoring, alerts and notifications, and drill-down capabilities to facilitate in-depth analysis.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Dashboard | A visual representation of data and metrics used to monitor and analyze operational quality. |
| KPI | A measurable value that indicates the performance of an operational process or system. |
| Metric | A quantitative measure used to evaluate the quality of an operational process or system. |
| Quality Gate | A checkpoint in a process where quality is evaluated and verified. |
| Threshold | A predefined limit or boundary for a metric or KPI, used to trigger alerts or notifications. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Operational Quality Dashboards include data integration, visualization, and analysis. Data integration involves collecting and combining data from various sources, while visualization involves presenting this data in a clear and concise manner. Analysis involves using statistical methods and techniques to identify trends, patterns, and correlations within the data. Additionally, core concepts include the use of KPIs and metrics to measure performance, the establishment of quality gates to ensure quality standards, and the setting of thresholds to trigger alerts and notifications.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Operational Quality Dashboards typically includes the following components: data ingestion, data processing, data storage, data visualization, and alerting and notification. Data ingestion involves collecting data from various sources, while data processing involves transforming and aggregating this data. Data storage involves storing the processed data in a database or data warehouse, while data visualization involves presenting this data through interactive dashboards. Alerting and notification involve sending notifications to users when thresholds are exceeded or quality gates are not met.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in Operational Quality Dashboards include the use of real-time monitoring, the implementation of automated alerting and notification systems, and the integration with other systems such as CRM or ERP. Additionally, common patterns include the use of customizable dashboards, the implementation of role-based access control, and the provision of drill-down capabilities for in-depth analysis.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in Operational Quality Dashboards include the use of static or non-interactive dashboards, the lack of automated alerting and notification systems, and the failure to integrate with other systems. Additionally, anti-patterns include the use of overly complex or cluttered dashboards, the lack of customizable dashboards, and the failure to provide drill-down capabilities for in-depth analysis.
