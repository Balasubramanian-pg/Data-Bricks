Canonical documentation for 121. Quality Frameworks with DLT. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 121. Quality Frameworks with DLT exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of 121. Quality Frameworks with DLT is to provide a structured approach to ensuring the quality of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) systems. The problem space addressed by this framework includes the lack of standardization, inconsistent data quality, and inadequate security measures in DLT implementations. By providing a comprehensive quality framework, organizations can mitigate these risks and ensure the reliability, scalability, and maintainability of their DLT systems.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of 121. Quality Frameworks with DLT involves a multi-layered approach to quality assurance, encompassing the following key aspects:
- **Security**: Ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data and transactions.
- **Data Quality**: Verifying the accuracy, completeness, and consistency of data stored on the ledger.
- **Scalability**: Ensuring the system can handle increased traffic and data storage needs.
- **Interoperability**: Facilitating seamless interaction between different DLT systems and external entities.
- **Governance**: Establishing clear policies, procedures, and standards for DLT development and maintenance.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) | A decentralized database that allows multiple parties to record and verify transactions without the need for a central authority. |
| Smart Contract | A self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement written directly into lines of code, stored and replicated on a blockchain or DLT. |
| Node | A computer or device connected to a DLT network, responsible for verifying and validating transactions. |
| Consensus Algorithm | A mechanism used to achieve agreement among nodes on the state of the ledger, ensuring the integrity of the data. |
| Blockchain | A type of DLT that uses a chain of blocks to store data in a sequential and immutable manner. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of 121. Quality Frameworks with DLT include:
- **Decentralization**: The distribution of data and control across a network of nodes, rather than relying on a central authority.
- **Immutable Ledger**: A ledger that, once written, cannot be altered or deleted, ensuring the permanence and integrity of the data.
- **Consensus Mechanisms**: The processes by which nodes agree on the state of the ledger, preventing a single point of failure or manipulation.
- **Cryptography**: The use of encryption and digital signatures to secure data and transactions, protecting against unauthorized access and tampering.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for 121. Quality Frameworks with DLT involves a layered approach, consisting of:
1. **Foundation Layer**: Establishing the fundamental principles and policies for DLT development and deployment.
2. **Security Layer**: Implementing robust security measures to protect data and transactions.
3. **Data Quality Layer**: Ensuring the accuracy, completeness, and consistency of data stored on the ledger.
4. **Scalability Layer**: Designing the system to handle increased traffic and data storage needs.
5. **Interoperability Layer**: Facilitating seamless interaction between different DLT systems and external entities.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in 121. Quality Frameworks with DLT include:
- **Microservices Architecture**: Breaking down the system into smaller, independent services to improve scalability and maintainability.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Designing the system to respond to events and transactions in real-time, improving responsiveness and efficiency.
- **Continuous Integration and Delivery**: Automating the testing, building, and deployment of code changes to ensure rapid and reliable delivery.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in 121. Quality Frameworks with DLT include:
- **Centralized Governance**: Relying on a single authority to control and manage the DLT system, undermining the principles of decentralization.
- **Inadequate Testing**: Failing to thoroughly test the system, leading to bugs, vulnerabilities, and performance issues.
- **Insufficient Documentation**: Neglecting to maintain accurate and up-to-date documentation, hindering maintenance, and future development.
