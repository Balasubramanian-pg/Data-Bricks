# 122. Data Contracts and SLAs

Canonical documentation for 122. Data Contracts and SLAs. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 122. Data Contracts and SLAs exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of Data Contracts and SLAs (Service Level Agreements) is to establish a clear understanding between parties involved in data exchange, ensuring that data is handled, processed, and delivered according to predefined standards and expectations. This addresses the class of problems related to data quality, reliability, and consistency, which can lead to errors, misunderstandings, and disputes between data providers and consumers.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Data Contracts and SLAs represent a formal agreement between two or more parties that defines the terms and conditions for data exchange, including data quality, format, frequency, and delivery mechanisms. This agreement serves as a foundation for ensuring that data is accurate, complete, and delivered in a timely manner, thereby facilitating trust and cooperation between parties.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Data Contract | A formal agreement that outlines the terms and conditions for data exchange between two or more parties. |
| Service Level Agreement (SLA) | A component of a data contract that specifies the expected service quality, performance, and delivery standards. |
| Data Provider | An entity that supplies data to another party, often in accordance with a data contract. |
| Data Consumer | An entity that receives data from a data provider, often in accordance with a data contract. |
| Data Quality | The degree to which data is accurate, complete, and consistent, meeting the requirements and expectations of the data consumer. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Data Contracts and SLAs include:
* **Data Governance**: The overall management and oversight of data exchange, ensuring that data is handled and processed in accordance with established policies and procedures.
* **Data Quality Management**: The processes and procedures used to ensure that data is accurate, complete, and consistent, meeting the requirements and expectations of the data consumer.
* **Service Level Management**: The monitoring and management of service levels, ensuring that data is delivered in accordance with the agreed-upon standards and expectations.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Data Contracts and SLAs typically includes the following components:
* **Data Contract Template**: A standardized template that outlines the terms and conditions for data exchange, including data quality, format, frequency, and delivery mechanisms.
* **SLA Metrics**: A set of predefined metrics used to measure service quality, performance, and delivery standards, such as data latency, data completeness, and data accuracy.
* **Dispute Resolution Process**: A formal process for resolving disputes or issues that arise during data exchange, ensuring that any problems are addressed in a timely and effective manner.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in Data Contracts and SLAs include:
* **Data Exchange Protocols**: Standardized protocols for data exchange, such as APIs, file transfers, or messaging queues.
* **Data Validation and Verification**: Processes used to validate and verify data quality, ensuring that data is accurate, complete, and consistent.
* **Service Level Monitoring**: Ongoing monitoring of service levels, ensuring that data is delivered in accordance with the agreed-upon standards and expectations.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in Data Contracts and SLAs include:
* **Lack of Clear Definitions**: Failure to clearly define terms and conditions, leading to misunderstandings and disputes.
* **Inadequate Data Quality Management**: Insufficient processes and procedures for ensuring data quality, leading to errors and inconsistencies.
* **Ineffective Dispute Resolution**: Inadequate or ineffective dispute resolution processes, leading to prolonged and unresolved issues.
