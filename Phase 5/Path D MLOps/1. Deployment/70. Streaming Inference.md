# 70. Streaming Inference

Canonical documentation for 70. Streaming Inference. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 70. Streaming Inference exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Streaming Inference is designed to address the need for real-time processing and analysis of continuous data streams. It enables organizations to extract insights and make decisions in a timely manner, responding to changing conditions and patterns in the data. The primary problem space includes applications such as IoT sensor data processing, financial transaction monitoring, and real-time recommendation systems.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Streaming Inference involves the use of machine learning models to analyze and process continuous data streams. This process typically includes data ingestion, preprocessing, model deployment, and inference, with the goal of generating predictions, classifications, or other insights in real-time. The conceptual model consists of three primary components: data sources, inference engines, and action triggers.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Streaming Data | A continuous flow of data generated by various sources, such as sensors, applications, or social media platforms. |
| Inference Engine | A software component responsible for deploying and executing machine learning models on streaming data. |
| Model Serving | The process of deploying trained machine learning models in a production environment, making them available for inference. |
| Real-time Processing | The ability to process and analyze data as it is generated, with minimal latency. |
| Batch Processing | The processing of data in batches, where data is collected and processed in intervals. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Streaming Inference include:
* **Data Ingestion**: The process of collecting and transporting data from various sources to a centralized location for processing.
* **Data Preprocessing**: The process of cleaning, transforming, and preparing data for analysis.
* **Model Deployment**: The process of integrating trained machine learning models into the inference engine.
* **Inference**: The process of using deployed models to generate predictions or insights from streaming data.
* **Feedback Loops**: The process of using output from the inference engine to update the model or adjust the processing pipeline.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Streaming Inference typically consists of the following components:
1. **Data Sources**: Generate streaming data, such as sensors, applications, or social media platforms.
2. **Data Ingestion Layer**: Collects and transports data to a centralized location for processing.
3. **Data Preprocessing Layer**: Cleans, transforms, and prepares data for analysis.
4. **Inference Engine**: Deploys and executes machine learning models on streaming data.
5. **Action Triggers**: Receive output from the inference engine and trigger actions or decisions.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in Streaming Inference include:
* **Event-driven Architecture**: Designing the processing pipeline to respond to specific events or patterns in the data.
* **Micro-batch Processing**: Processing data in small batches to balance latency and throughput.
* **Model Updates**: Periodically updating the deployed model to adapt to changing patterns in the data.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in Streaming Inference include:
* **Batch Processing**: Processing data in large batches, leading to high latency and delayed decision-making.
* **Over-engineering**: Designing the processing pipeline with unnecessary complexity, leading to increased maintenance and operational costs.
* **Insufficient Monitoring**: Failing to monitor the processing pipeline and deployed models, leading to decreased performance and accuracy.
