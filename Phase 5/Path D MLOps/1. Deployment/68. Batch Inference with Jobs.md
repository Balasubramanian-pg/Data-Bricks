> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 68. Batch Inference with Jobs exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Batch Inference with Jobs is designed to address the need for efficient and scalable processing of large datasets in machine learning and data analytics. The primary problem it solves is the ability to handle massive volumes of data that require prediction or inference, which can be computationally intensive and time-consuming. By leveraging batch processing, organizations can streamline their workflows, reduce processing times, and improve overall productivity.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Batch Inference with Jobs involves the use of jobs to manage and execute batch inference workloads. A job represents a self-contained unit of work that encompasses data processing, model execution, and result storage. This approach enables the efficient processing of large datasets by breaking them down into smaller, manageable chunks, and executing them in parallel across multiple computing resources.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Batch Inference | The process of applying a machine learning model to a large dataset in batches, rather than processing individual data points. |
| Job | A self-contained unit of work that represents a batch inference workload, including data processing, model execution, and result storage. |
| Dataset | A collection of data points used for training, testing, or inference in machine learning models. |
| Model | A mathematical representation of a system, process, or relationship, used for prediction, classification, or regression tasks. |
| Inference | The process of using a trained model to make predictions or draw conclusions from new, unseen data. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Batch Inference with Jobs include:
* **Data Partitioning**: dividing large datasets into smaller, manageable chunks for parallel processing.
* **Job Scheduling**: managing the execution of jobs across multiple computing resources to optimize resource utilization and minimize processing times.
* **Model Serving**: deploying trained models in a production-ready environment for inference and prediction.
* **Result Storage**: storing and managing the output of batch inference jobs for further analysis or downstream processing.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Batch Inference with Jobs involves the following components:
* **Data Ingestion**: loading and preparing datasets for batch inference.
* **Job Submission**: submitting jobs to a job scheduler or workflow manager.
* **Job Execution**: executing jobs on computing resources, such as clusters or cloud services.
* **Result Storage**: storing and managing job output for further analysis or downstream processing.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in Batch Inference with Jobs include:
* **Data Processing Pipelines**: using workflows to manage data ingestion, processing, and storage.
* **Model Deployment**: deploying trained models in a production-ready environment for inference and prediction.
* **Job Chaining**: executing multiple jobs in a sequence to perform complex workflows.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in Batch Inference with Jobs include:
* **Over-Engineering**: using overly complex workflows or architectures that are difficult to maintain or scale.
* **Under-Utilization**: failing to optimize resource utilization, leading to wasted computing resources or prolonged processing times.
* **Lack of Monitoring**: neglecting to monitor job execution, leading to undetected errors or performance issues.
