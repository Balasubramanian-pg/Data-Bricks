## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 69. Real Time Inference with Model Serving exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Real Time Inference with Model Serving exists to facilitate the deployment of machine learning models in production environments, enabling real-time predictions and decision-making. The class of problems it addresses includes the need for low-latency, high-throughput, and scalable model serving, as well as the requirement for seamless integration with existing infrastructure and applications.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of Real Time Inference with Model Serving involves a pipeline that includes model training, model deployment, and model serving. The pipeline is designed to support the entire lifecycle of a machine learning model, from development to production, and to provide a scalable and flexible framework for real-time inference.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Model Serving | The process of deploying a trained machine learning model in a production environment, enabling real-time predictions and decision-making. |
| Real-Time Inference | The ability to generate predictions or take actions in real-time, based on input data and a deployed machine learning model. |
| Low-Latency | The ability of a system to respond quickly to input data, typically measured in milliseconds or microseconds. |
| High-Throughput | The ability of a system to process large volumes of data quickly and efficiently. |
| Scalability | The ability of a system to handle increased load or demand, without compromising performance or responsiveness. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Real Time Inference with Model Serving include:
* **Model Deployment**: The process of deploying a trained machine learning model in a production environment.
* **Model Serving**: The process of providing real-time predictions and decision-making based on a deployed machine learning model.
* **Low-Latency**: The ability of a system to respond quickly to input data.
* **High-Throughput**: The ability of a system to process large volumes of data quickly and efficiently.
* **Scalability**: The ability of a system to handle increased load or demand, without compromising performance or responsiveness.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Real Time Inference with Model Serving involves a microservices-based architecture, with separate components for model deployment, model serving, and data processing. The model is typically deployed in a containerized environment, such as Docker, and is served using a RESTful API or other interface.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for Real Time Inference with Model Serving include:
* **Request-Response Pattern**: A pattern in which a client sends a request to a model serving system, and receives a response in real-time.
* **Streaming Pattern**: A pattern in which a client sends a stream of data to a model serving system, and receives a stream of predictions or responses in real-time.
* **Batch Processing Pattern**: A pattern in which a client sends a batch of data to a model serving system, and receives a batch of predictions or responses in real-time.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for Real Time Inference with Model Serving include:
* **Monolithic Architecture**: A pattern in which a single, monolithic component is responsible for model deployment, model serving, and data processing.
* **Tight Coupling**: A pattern in which components are tightly coupled, making it difficult to modify or replace individual components without affecting the entire system.
* **Lack of Monitoring and Logging**: A pattern in which a system lacks adequate monitoring and logging, making it difficult to diagnose and troubleshoot issues.
