Canonical documentation for 74. GitOps Workflows for ML. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 74. GitOps Workflows for ML exists and the class of problems it addresses.
GitOps Workflows for ML exist to address the challenges of managing and deploying machine learning (ML) models in a scalable, reproducible, and auditable manner. The class of problems it addresses includes: 
- Version control and management of ML models and their dependencies
- Automated deployment and rollback of ML models
- Consistency and reproducibility of ML model training and deployment environments
- Auditing and compliance for ML model deployment and usage

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of GitOps Workflows for ML involves a closed-loop system where ML models are developed, trained, and deployed using a GitOps approach. This approach uses Git as a single source of truth for ML model definitions, data, and configurations. The system automates the build, test, and deployment of ML models using continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| GitOps | An operational model that uses Git as a single source of truth for infrastructure and application configurations |
| ML Model | A mathematical model trained on data to make predictions or take actions |
| CI/CD Pipeline | A series of automated processes that build, test, and deploy software applications |
| Infrastructure as Code (IaC) | The practice of managing infrastructure configurations using code |
| Model Serving | The process of deploying and managing ML models in production environments |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of GitOps Workflows for ML include:
- **Declarative Configuration**: ML model definitions, data, and configurations are defined in a declarative manner using files and directories.
- **Version Control**: Git is used as a version control system to manage changes to ML model definitions, data, and configurations.
- **Automation**: CI/CD pipelines automate the build, test, and deployment of ML models.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Infrastructure configurations are managed using code to ensure consistency and reproducibility.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for GitOps Workflows for ML involves the following components:
- **Git Repository**: A Git repository serves as the single source of truth for ML model definitions, data, and configurations.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: A CI/CD pipeline automates the build, test, and deployment of ML models.
- **Model Serving Platform**: A model serving platform manages the deployment and serving of ML models in production environments.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Monitoring and logging tools track the performance and behavior of ML models in production environments.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in GitOps Workflows for ML include:
- **Model Training and Deployment**: ML models are trained and deployed using a CI/CD pipeline.
- **Model Serving and Monitoring**: ML models are served and monitored using a model serving platform and monitoring tools.
- **Data Management**: Data is managed and versioned using a data management system.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in GitOps Workflows for ML include:
- **Manual Deployment**: Manual deployment of ML models, which can lead to inconsistencies and errors.
- **Unversioned Data**: Unversioned data, which can lead to data inconsistencies and loss.
- **Unautomated Testing**: Unautomated testing, which can lead to errors and inconsistencies in ML models.
