# 75. Automated Model Packaging

Canonical documentation for 75. Automated Model Packaging. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 75. Automated Model Packaging exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Automated Model Packaging is designed to streamline the process of deploying and managing machine learning models in various environments. The primary problem it addresses is the manual effort and complexity involved in packaging, deploying, and maintaining models, which can lead to errors, inconsistencies, and inefficiencies. By automating the packaging process, developers can focus on model development and improvement, while ensuring seamless integration and deployment.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Automated Model Packaging involves a set of tools and processes that automatically prepare and package machine learning models for deployment. This includes tasks such as model serialization, dependency management, and environment configuration. The packaged model is then deployed to a target environment, such as a cloud platform, containerization platform, or edge device, where it can be executed and managed.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Model Packaging | The process of preparing and bundling a machine learning model for deployment. |
| Model Serialization | The process of converting a machine learning model into a format that can be written to a file or transmitted over a network. |
| Dependency Management | The process of identifying, resolving, and managing the dependencies required by a machine learning model. |
| Environment Configuration | The process of configuring the environment in which a machine learning model will be deployed, including settings such as hardware, software, and networking. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Automated Model Packaging include:
* **Model Abstraction**: The process of decoupling the machine learning model from the underlying infrastructure and dependencies.
* **Dependency Injection**: The process of providing the dependencies required by the model at deployment time.
* **Environment Virtualization**: The process of creating a virtualized environment that matches the requirements of the model.
* **Packaging Formats**: The various formats used to package and deploy machine learning models, such as Docker containers, TensorFlow SavedModel, and PyTorch JIT.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Automated Model Packaging involves the following steps:
1. **Model Development**: Develop and train the machine learning model.
2. **Model Serialization**: Serialize the model into a format that can be written to a file or transmitted over a network.
3. **Dependency Management**: Identify and resolve the dependencies required by the model.
4. **Environment Configuration**: Configure the environment in which the model will be deployed.
5. **Packaging**: Package the model, dependencies, and environment configuration into a deployable format.
6. **Deployment**: Deploy the packaged model to the target environment.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in Automated Model Packaging include:
* **Containerization**: Using containerization platforms such as Docker to package and deploy models.
* **Serverless Deployment**: Deploying models to serverless platforms such as AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions.
* **Edge Deployment**: Deploying models to edge devices such as smartphones, smart home devices, or autonomous vehicles.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in Automated Model Packaging include:
* **Manual Packaging**: Manually packaging and deploying models, which can lead to errors and inconsistencies.
* **Tight Coupling**: Tightly coupling the model to the underlying infrastructure and dependencies, which can make it difficult to deploy and manage.
* **Lack of Testing**: Failing to test the packaged model in the target environment, which can lead to errors and downtime.
