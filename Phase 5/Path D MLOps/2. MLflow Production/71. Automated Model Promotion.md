# 71. Automated Model Promotion

Canonical documentation for 71. Automated Model Promotion. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 71. Automated Model Promotion exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Automated Model Promotion is designed to streamline the process of deploying machine learning models into production environments, addressing the challenges of manual model deployment, versioning, and monitoring. The primary problem it solves is the lack of automation in promoting models from development to production, which can lead to delays, inconsistencies, and errors.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Automated Model Promotion involves a series of automated workflows that integrate model development, testing, validation, and deployment. This process ensures that models are consistently and reliably promoted to production, reducing the risk of human error and increasing the speed of deployment.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Model | A mathematical representation of a system, process, or relationship used to make predictions or decisions. |
| Promotion | The process of deploying a model from a development or staging environment to a production environment. |
| Automated Workflow | A series of automated tasks that execute in a specific order to perform a complex process, such as model promotion. |
| Model Versioning | The practice of assigning a unique identifier to each version of a model, enabling tracking and management of changes. |
| Model Monitoring | The ongoing process of tracking a model's performance and data in a production environment. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Automated Model Promotion include:
* Model development and testing
* Automated workflows for model promotion
* Model versioning and change management
* Model monitoring and performance tracking
* Integration with existing DevOps and MLOps tools and pipelines

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Automated Model Promotion involves the following stages:
1. Model development and testing
2. Model validation and verification
3. Automated model promotion to production
4. Model monitoring and performance tracking
5. Continuous model improvement and refinement

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in Automated Model Promotion include:
* Using containerization (e.g., Docker) to package and deploy models
* Implementing automated testing and validation using frameworks (e.g., Pytest, Unittest)
* Utilizing workflow management tools (e.g., Apache Airflow, Zapier) to automate model promotion
* Integrating with existing DevOps and MLOps tools (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD)

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in Automated Model Promotion include:
* Manual model deployment and promotion
* Lack of model versioning and change management
* Insufficient model monitoring and performance tracking
* Not integrating with existing DevOps and MLOps tools and pipelines
* Not using automated testing and validation
