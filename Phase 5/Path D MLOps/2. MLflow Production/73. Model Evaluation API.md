Canonical documentation for 73. Model Evaluation API. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
The 73. Model Evaluation API exists to provide a standardized framework for assessing the performance and effectiveness of machine learning models. It addresses the class of problems related to model validation, selection, and optimization, enabling developers to compare and contrast different models, identify areas for improvement, and ensure that their models are fair, transparent, and reliable.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
The 73. Model Evaluation API is based on a high-level mental model that involves the following key components: data, models, metrics, and evaluation protocols. This API provides a structured approach to model evaluation, allowing developers to define evaluation workflows, execute them, and analyze the results.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Model | A mathematical representation of a system, process, or relationship, trained on data to make predictions or decisions. |
| Metric | A quantitative measure used to evaluate the performance of a model, such as accuracy, precision, or recall. |
| Evaluation Protocol | A predefined procedure for assessing a model's performance, including the selection of metrics, data, and experimental design. |
| Hyperparameter | A parameter that is set before training a model, such as learning rate or regularization strength. |
| Cross-Validation | A technique for evaluating a model's performance by training and testing it on multiple subsets of the available data. |

## 4. Core Concepts
The fundamental ideas that form the basis of the 73. Model Evaluation API include:
* **Model selection**: The process of choosing the best model for a given problem, based on its performance on a validation set.
* **Model optimization**: The process of adjusting a model's hyperparameters to improve its performance on a validation set.
* **Model evaluation**: The process of assessing a model's performance on a test set, using metrics such as accuracy, precision, or recall.

## 5. Standard Model
The standard model for the 73. Model Evaluation API involves the following steps:
1. **Data preparation**: Split the available data into training, validation, and test sets.
2. **Model training**: Train a model on the training set, using a predefined set of hyperparameters.
3. **Model evaluation**: Evaluate the trained model on the validation set, using a predefined set of metrics.
4. **Model optimization**: Adjust the model's hyperparameters to improve its performance on the validation set.
5. **Model deployment**: Deploy the optimized model to a production environment, where it can be used to make predictions or decisions.

## 6. Common Patterns
Common patterns in model evaluation include:
* **K-fold cross-validation**: A technique for evaluating a model's performance by training and testing it on multiple subsets of the available data.
* **Grid search**: A technique for optimizing a model's hyperparameters by searching over a predefined grid of possible values.
* **Random search**: A technique for optimizing a model's hyperparameters by randomly sampling from a predefined distribution of possible values.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Common but discouraged practices in model evaluation include:
* **Overfitting**: The practice of training a model on a small dataset, resulting in poor generalization performance.
* **Underfitting**: The practice of training a model with too few parameters, resulting in poor performance on the training set.
* **Data leakage**: The practice of using information from the test set to influence the model's performance on the validation set.
