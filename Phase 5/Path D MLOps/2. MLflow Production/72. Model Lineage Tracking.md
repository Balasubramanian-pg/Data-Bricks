# 72. Model Lineage Tracking

Canonical documentation for 72. Model Lineage Tracking. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 72. Model Lineage Tracking exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Model Lineage Tracking exists to provide a transparent and reproducible record of machine learning model development, deployment, and maintenance. It addresses the class of problems related to model explainability, accountability, and trustworthiness. The primary purpose is to track the origin, evolution, and usage of models, enabling data scientists, engineers, and stakeholders to understand how models are created, validated, and improved over time.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Model Lineage Tracking involves capturing and managing metadata about machine learning models, including data sources, algorithms, hyperparameters, training datasets, and evaluation metrics. This metadata is used to create a directed graph that represents the model's lineage, allowing users to navigate the model's development history, identify potential biases, and reproduce results.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Model Lineage | The record of a model's origin, evolution, and usage, including metadata about data sources, algorithms, and hyperparameters. |
| Model Provenance | The documentation of a model's creation, including information about the data, algorithms, and processes used to develop the model. |
| Data Lineage | The record of data origin, processing, and usage, including metadata about data sources, transformations, and quality. |
| Model Versioning | The practice of assigning unique identifiers to different versions of a model, enabling tracking of changes and updates. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Model Lineage Tracking include:
* **Model metadata management**: capturing and storing metadata about models, including data sources, algorithms, and hyperparameters.
* **Model versioning**: assigning unique identifiers to different versions of a model, enabling tracking of changes and updates.
* **Data lineage**: tracking the origin, processing, and usage of data, including metadata about data sources, transformations, and quality.
* **Model reproducibility**: ensuring that models can be reproduced and reused, using the same data, algorithms, and hyperparameters.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Model Lineage Tracking involves the following components:
* **Model registry**: a centralized repository for storing model metadata, including model versions, data sources, and algorithms.
* **Data catalog**: a centralized repository for storing data metadata, including data sources, transformations, and quality.
* **Lineage graph**: a directed graph that represents the model's lineage, including relationships between models, data, and algorithms.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in Model Lineage Tracking include:
* **Model versioning**: using unique identifiers to track changes and updates to models.
* **Data quality monitoring**: tracking data quality and integrity, including data validation and data cleansing.
* **Model validation**: evaluating model performance and accuracy, including metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in Model Lineage Tracking include:
* **Lack of model versioning**: failing to track changes and updates to models, making it difficult to reproduce results.
* **Insufficient data quality monitoring**: neglecting to track data quality and integrity, leading to biased or inaccurate models.
* **Inadequate model validation**: failing to evaluate model performance and accuracy, leading to poor model reliability.
