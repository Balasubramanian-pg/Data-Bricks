## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 78. Data Quality for Inference exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The primary purpose of Data Quality for Inference is to ensure that the data used for machine learning model training and inference is accurate, complete, and consistent. The problem space addressed by Data Quality for Inference includes issues such as noisy or missing data, data inconsistencies, and concept drift, which can significantly impact the performance and reliability of machine learning models. By addressing these issues, Data Quality for Inference enables organizations to build trustworthy and effective machine learning systems.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Data Quality for Inference involves a set of processes and techniques aimed at evaluating, improving, and maintaining the quality of data used for machine learning model training and inference. This includes data profiling, data validation, data cleansing, and data normalization, as well as ongoing monitoring and maintenance of data quality. The goal is to ensure that the data is fit for purpose, meaning it is suitable for the specific machine learning task at hand, and that it meets the required standards for accuracy, completeness, and consistency.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Data Quality | The degree to which data is accurate, complete, consistent, and reliable. |
| Data Profiling | The process of analyzing and summarizing data to understand its distribution, patterns, and relationships. |
| Data Validation | The process of checking data against a set of rules or constraints to ensure it is correct and consistent. |
| Data Cleansing | The process of correcting or removing errors, inconsistencies, or duplicates from data. |
| Concept Drift | The phenomenon where the underlying distribution of data changes over time, affecting the performance of machine learning models. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Data Quality for Inference include:
* **Data accuracy**: ensuring that the data is free from errors and inconsistencies.
* **Data completeness**: ensuring that all required data is present and available.
* **Data consistency**: ensuring that the data is consistent in format, structure, and content.
* **Data reliability**: ensuring that the data is trustworthy and can be relied upon for decision-making.
* **Data monitoring**: ongoing monitoring of data quality to detect and address issues.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Data Quality for Inference involves the following steps:
1. **Data ingestion**: collecting and integrating data from various sources.
2. **Data profiling**: analyzing and summarizing data to understand its distribution, patterns, and relationships.
3. **Data validation**: checking data against a set of rules or constraints to ensure it is correct and consistent.
4. **Data cleansing**: correcting or removing errors, inconsistencies, or duplicates from data.
5. **Data normalization**: transforming data into a standard format to ensure consistency and comparability.
6. **Data monitoring**: ongoing monitoring of data quality to detect and address issues.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in Data Quality for Inference include:
* **Data quality metrics**: using metrics such as accuracy, completeness, and consistency to measure data quality.
* **Data quality thresholds**: setting thresholds for data quality metrics to determine when data is fit for purpose.
* **Data quality workflows**: establishing workflows to automate data quality processes and ensure consistency.
* **Data quality monitoring**: using dashboards and alerts to monitor data quality and detect issues.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in Data Quality for Inference include:
* **Ignoring data quality issues**: failing to address data quality issues, which can lead to poor model performance and unreliable results.
* **Using incomplete or inaccurate data**: using data that is incomplete or inaccurate, which can lead to biased or incorrect results.
* **Not monitoring data quality**: failing to monitor data quality, which can lead to undetected issues and poor model performance.
* **Not documenting data quality processes**: failing to document data quality processes, which can lead to lack of transparency and reproducibility.
