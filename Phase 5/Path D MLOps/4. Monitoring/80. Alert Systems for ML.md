> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 80. Alert Systems for ML exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of Alert Systems for ML is to provide a proactive and automated monitoring system for machine learning (ML) models, enabling swift detection of anomalies, data drift, and model degradation. This addresses the class of problems related to ensuring the reliability, accuracy, and performance of ML models in production environments. Alert Systems for ML help mitigate issues such as concept drift, data quality problems, and model bias, which can significantly impact the effectiveness and trustworthiness of ML-powered applications.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Alert Systems for ML operate by integrating with ML pipelines and monitoring key performance indicators (KPIs) such as model accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and other relevant metrics. These systems leverage statistical methods, machine learning algorithms, and rule-based approaches to identify deviations from expected behavior, triggering alerts and notifications when predefined thresholds are exceeded. This enables data scientists, engineers, and other stakeholders to take corrective actions, ensuring the continuous reliability and performance of ML models.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Alert | A notification triggered by an alert system in response to a detected anomaly or threshold exceedance. |
| Anomaly Detection | The process of identifying data points or patterns that deviate significantly from expected behavior. |
| Data Drift | The gradual change in data distribution over time, which can affect the performance and accuracy of ML models. |
| Model Degradation | The decline in performance of an ML model over time, often due to concept drift, data quality issues, or other factors. |
| Threshold | A predefined value or range that serves as a boundary for triggering alerts or notifications. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Alert Systems for ML include:
* **Real-time monitoring**: Continuous tracking of ML model performance and data quality.
* **Anomaly detection**: Identifying unusual patterns or data points that may indicate issues with the model or data.
* **Threshold-based alerting**: Triggering notifications when predefined thresholds are exceeded.
* **Root cause analysis**: Investigating the underlying causes of detected anomalies or performance issues.
* **Corrective actions**: Taking targeted actions to address identified problems and prevent future occurrences.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Alert Systems for ML typically involves the following components:
1. **Data ingestion**: Collecting and processing data from various sources.
2. **Model monitoring**: Tracking ML model performance and KPIs.
3. **Anomaly detection**: Identifying deviations from expected behavior.
4. **Alert generation**: Triggering notifications based on predefined thresholds.
5. **Notification and escalation**: Sending alerts to stakeholders and escalating issues as needed.
6. **Root cause analysis and corrective actions**: Investigating and addressing identified problems.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in Alert Systems for ML include:
* **Simple thresholding**: Triggering alerts when a single metric exceeds a predefined threshold.
* **Composite alerting**: Combining multiple metrics or conditions to trigger alerts.
* **Time-based alerting**: Triggering alerts based on temporal patterns or schedules.
* **Machine learning-based alerting**: Using ML algorithms to detect anomalies and trigger alerts.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in Alert Systems for ML include:
* **Over-alerting**: Triggering too many alerts, leading to alert fatigue and decreased responsiveness.
* **Under-alerting**: Failing to detect critical issues, resulting in delayed or inadequate responses.
* **Lack of customization**: Failing to tailor alerting thresholds and conditions to specific use cases or models.
* **Inadequate root cause analysis**: Failing to investigate and address the underlying causes of detected anomalies or performance issues.
