> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 79. Model Performance Dashboards exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The primary purpose of Model Performance Dashboards is to provide a centralized platform for monitoring, analyzing, and optimizing the performance of machine learning models in production environments. This addresses the problem of model drift, data quality issues, and suboptimal model performance, which can lead to significant business losses if left unaddressed. Model Performance Dashboards aim to bridge the gap between model development and deployment by providing real-time insights into model behavior, enabling data scientists and engineers to identify areas for improvement and take corrective actions.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Model Performance Dashboards can be conceptualized as a layered framework, consisting of data ingestion, processing, and visualization components. The data ingestion layer collects model performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, and recall, from various sources, including model serving platforms, logging systems, and data warehouses. The processing layer applies statistical and machine learning techniques to analyze the collected data, identifying trends, patterns, and anomalies. The visualization layer presents the insights and findings in a user-friendly and intuitive manner, using dashboards, charts, and graphs to facilitate exploration and decision-making.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Model Performance | The degree to which a machine learning model achieves its intended objectives, measured using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. |
| Dashboard | A visual representation of model performance data, providing real-time insights and trends. |
| Model Drift | The phenomenon of a machine learning model's performance degrading over time due to changes in the underlying data distribution or other environmental factors. |
| Data Quality | The degree to which the data used to train and evaluate a machine learning model is accurate, complete, and consistent. |
| Model Serving | The process of deploying a trained machine learning model in a production environment, where it can receive input data and generate predictions or recommendations. |
