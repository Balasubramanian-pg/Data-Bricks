# 110. Semantic Layer with Unity Catalog

Canonical documentation for 110. Semantic Layer with Unity Catalog. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 110. Semantic Layer with Unity Catalog exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The Semantic Layer with Unity Catalog is designed to provide a unified and standardized way of managing and accessing data across different sources and systems. It addresses the problems of data silos, inconsistent data definitions, and lack of data governance, which can lead to poor data quality, inefficient data processing, and inadequate decision-making. By providing a single, unified view of data, the Semantic Layer with Unity Catalog enables organizations to improve data discovery, reduce data duplication, and enhance data-driven decision-making.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The Semantic Layer with Unity Catalog is a layer of abstraction that sits between data sources and data consumers, providing a standardized and unified view of data. It consists of a catalog of data assets, a set of data definitions, and a set of rules and policies that govern data access and usage. The Semantic Layer with Unity Catalog provides a single source of truth for data, enabling data consumers to access and use data in a consistent and reliable manner.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Semantic Layer | A layer of abstraction that provides a standardized and unified view of data |
| Unity Catalog | A centralized repository of data assets, definitions, and policies |
| Data Asset | A collection of data that is managed and governed by the Semantic Layer |
| Data Definition | A standardized definition of a data element, including its meaning, format, and usage |
| Data Policy | A set of rules and guidelines that govern data access, usage, and management |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of the Semantic Layer with Unity Catalog include:
* Data abstraction: providing a layer of abstraction between data sources and data consumers
* Data standardization: standardizing data definitions and formats to ensure consistency and interoperability
* Data governance: establishing policies and rules to govern data access, usage, and management
* Data discovery: providing a centralized repository of data assets and definitions to enable data discovery and exploration

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for the Semantic Layer with Unity Catalog includes the following components:
* Data ingestion: ingesting data from various sources into the Unity Catalog
* Data processing: processing and transforming data to conform to standardized definitions and formats
* Data storage: storing data in a centralized repository, such as a data warehouse or data lake
* Data access: providing controlled access to data through standardized APIs and interfaces
* Data governance: establishing and enforcing policies and rules to govern data access, usage, and management

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for the Semantic Layer with Unity Catalog include:
* Data virtualization: providing a virtualized view of data to enable data access and usage without physically moving or copying data
* Data federation: federating data from multiple sources to provide a unified view of data
* Data warehousing: storing data in a centralized repository, such as a data warehouse, to enable data analysis and reporting

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for the Semantic Layer with Unity Catalog include:
* Data duplication: duplicating data across multiple systems and sources, leading to data inconsistencies and inefficiencies
* Data silos: creating isolated data silos that are not integrated or governed, leading to poor data quality and decision-making
* Lack of data governance: failing to establish and enforce policies and rules to govern data access, usage, and management, leading to data security and compliance risks
