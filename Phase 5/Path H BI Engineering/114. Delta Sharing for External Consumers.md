# 114. Delta Sharing for External Consumers

Canonical documentation for 114. Delta Sharing for External Consumers. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 114. Delta Sharing for External Consumers exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The primary purpose of Delta Sharing for External Consumers is to enable secure, real-time data sharing between organizations, allowing external consumers to access specific datasets while maintaining data governance and control. This addresses the problem of data silos, where valuable insights are locked within individual organizations, and facilitates collaboration, innovation, and decision-making.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Delta Sharing for External Consumers is a data sharing paradigm that leverages Delta Lake, an open-source storage layer that provides ACID transactions, data versioning, and other features. This allows data providers to share specific datasets with external consumers, who can then access the data in real-time, while ensuring data integrity, security, and governance.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Delta Lake | An open-source storage layer that provides ACID transactions, data versioning, and other features for reliable data management. |
| Data Provider | An organization that shares its data with external consumers through Delta Sharing. |
| External Consumer | An organization or individual that accesses shared data from a data provider through Delta Sharing. |
| Dataset | A collection of data that is shared by a data provider with external consumers. |
| Data Governance | The set of policies, procedures, and standards that ensure the security, integrity, and compliance of shared data. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Delta Sharing for External Consumers include:
* **Data Sharing**: The ability to share specific datasets with external consumers in real-time.
* **Data Governance**: The implementation of policies, procedures, and standards to ensure data security, integrity, and compliance.
* **Delta Lake**: The use of Delta Lake as a storage layer to provide ACID transactions, data versioning, and other features.
* **Access Control**: The ability to control access to shared data, including authentication, authorization, and encryption.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Delta Sharing for External Consumers involves the following components:
* **Data Provider**: The organization that shares its data with external consumers.
* **Delta Lake**: The storage layer that provides ACID transactions, data versioning, and other features.
* **Sharing Server**: The server that manages data sharing, including access control, authentication, and authorization.
* **External Consumer**: The organization or individual that accesses shared data.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for Delta Sharing for External Consumers include:
* **Real-time Data Sharing**: Sharing data in real-time to enable timely decision-making and collaboration.
* **Data Governance**: Implementing data governance policies, procedures, and standards to ensure data security, integrity, and compliance.
* **Access Control**: Implementing access control mechanisms, including authentication, authorization, and encryption, to control access to shared data.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for Delta Sharing for External Consumers include:
* **Data Silos**: Hoarding data within individual organizations, rather than sharing it with external consumers.
* **Lack of Data Governance**: Failing to implement data governance policies, procedures, and standards, which can lead to data breaches, inconsistencies, and non-compliance.
* **Insecure Data Sharing**: Sharing data without proper access control, authentication, authorization, and encryption, which can lead to data breaches and unauthorized access.
