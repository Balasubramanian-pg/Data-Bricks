> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 111. Low Latency Dashboard Design exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The primary purpose of Low Latency Dashboard Design is to provide real-time or near-real-time data visualization and feedback to users, enabling them to make informed decisions quickly. This design pattern addresses the problem of delayed or sluggish dashboard performance, which can lead to decreased user engagement, productivity, and overall system effectiveness. The class of problems it addresses includes, but is not limited to, financial trading platforms, real-time monitoring systems, and live analytics dashboards.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Low Latency Dashboard Design involves a combination of optimized data processing, efficient data visualization, and streamlined user interaction. It requires a deep understanding of the underlying data, the user's needs, and the technical capabilities of the system. The design should prioritize speed, simplicity, and clarity, ensuring that users can quickly and easily access the information they need to make timely decisions.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Latency | The delay between the time data is generated and the time it is displayed to the user. |
| Real-time Data | Data that is processed and displayed to the user as soon as it is generated, typically within a few seconds or milliseconds. |
| Dashboard | A visual representation of data and metrics, often used to monitor and analyze performance, trends, and other key indicators. |
| Data Visualization | The process of representing data in a graphical or chart-based format to facilitate understanding and insight. |
| Optimization | The process of improving the performance, efficiency, or effectiveness of a system or process. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Low Latency Dashboard Design include:
* **Data Ingestion**: The process of collecting, processing, and storing data from various sources.
* **Data Processing**: The process of transforming, aggregating, and analyzing data to extract insights and meaningful information.
* **Data Visualization**: The process of representing data in a graphical or chart-based format to facilitate understanding and insight.
* **User Interaction**: The process of designing intuitive and responsive interfaces that enable users to interact with the dashboard and access the information they need quickly and easily.
* **Performance Optimization**: The process of improving the speed, efficiency, and effectiveness of the dashboard, including minimizing latency, reducing load times, and optimizing resource utilization.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Low Latency Dashboard Design typically involves the following components:
* **Data Layer**: Responsible for collecting, processing, and storing data from various sources.
* **Application Layer**: Responsible for transforming, aggregating, and analyzing data to extract insights and meaningful information.
* **Presentation Layer**: Responsible for representing data in a graphical or chart-based format to facilitate understanding and insight.
* **User Interface**: Responsible for providing an intuitive and responsive interface for users to interact with the dashboard.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in Low Latency Dashboard Design include:
* **Real-time Updates**: Updating the dashboard in real-time as new data becomes available.
* **Incremental Loading**: Loading data incrementally, rather than all at once, to reduce latency and improve performance.
* **Caching**: Storing frequently accessed data in memory to reduce the need for database queries and improve performance.
* **Optimized Data Visualization**: Using optimized data visualization techniques, such as aggregation, filtering, and grouping, to reduce the amount of data being displayed and improve performance.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Common anti-patterns in Low Latency Dashboard Design include:
* **Over-Engineering**: Over-complicating the design or architecture of the dashboard, leading to increased latency and decreased performance.
* **Under-Optimization**: Failing to optimize the dashboard for performance, leading to slow load times and poor user experience.
* **Data Overload**: Displaying too much data, leading to information overload and decreased user engagement.
* **Poor User Interface**: Designing a user interface that is cluttered, confusing, or difficult to use, leading to decreased user adoption and satisfaction.
