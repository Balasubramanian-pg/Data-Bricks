> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 109. SQL Warehouses for BI exists and the class of problems it addresses.
SQL Warehouses for Business Intelligence (BI) exist to provide a centralized repository for storing and managing large volumes of data from various sources, enabling organizations to make data-driven decisions. The primary problem space addressed by SQL Warehouses for BI includes data silos, inconsistent data, and the inability to perform complex analytics. By integrating data from multiple sources into a single repository, SQL Warehouses for BI facilitate data standardization, aggregation, and analysis, thereby supporting business intelligence and decision-making.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
A SQL Warehouse for BI is a database designed to store and manage large datasets, providing a single source of truth for organizational data. It is typically built using a relational database management system (RDBMS) and is optimized for querying and analyzing large datasets. The conceptual overview of a SQL Warehouse for BI includes the following components: data sources, data integration, data storage, data processing, and data analysis.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Data Warehouse | A centralized repository that stores data from various sources in a single location, making it easier to access and analyze. |
| Business Intelligence (BI) | The process of collecting, analyzing, and presenting data to support business decision-making. |
| ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) | A process used to extract data from multiple sources, transform it into a standardized format, and load it into a target system, such as a data warehouse. |
| OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) | A technology that enables fast and efficient analysis of data, typically used in data warehouses and business intelligence applications. |
| Data Mart | A subset of a data warehouse that contains a specific set of data, often used to support a specific business function or department. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of SQL Warehouses for BI include:
* Data integration: combining data from multiple sources into a single repository
* Data standardization: converting data into a consistent format to facilitate analysis
* Data aggregation: summarizing data to provide insights and trends
* Data analysis: using various techniques, such as OLAP and data mining, to extract insights from data
* Data governance: managing data quality, security, and access to ensure that data is accurate, reliable, and secure

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for a SQL Warehouse for BI typically includes the following components:
* Data sources: various systems and applications that provide data to the warehouse
* ETL process: a process that extracts data from sources, transforms it into a standardized format, and loads it into the warehouse
* Data storage: a relational database management system (RDBMS) that stores the integrated data
* Data processing: a layer that provides data aggregation, analysis, and reporting capabilities
* Data analysis: a layer that provides tools and technologies for data analysis, such as OLAP and data mining

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in SQL Warehouses for BI include:
* Star and snowflake schema designs: used to optimize data storage and querying performance
* Fact and dimension tables: used to separate data into measurable facts and descriptive dimensions
* ETL workflows: used to automate the process of extracting, transforming, and loading data
* Data marting: used to create subsets of data to support specific business functions or departments

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in SQL Warehouses for BI include:
* Data duplication: storing duplicate data in multiple locations, leading to data inconsistencies and inefficiencies
* Lack of data governance: failing to manage data quality, security, and access, leading to data breaches and inaccuracies
* Inadequate data modeling: failing to design a robust and scalable data model, leading to performance issues and data inconsistencies
* Insufficient data validation: failing to validate data for accuracy and consistency, leading to data errors and inaccuracies
