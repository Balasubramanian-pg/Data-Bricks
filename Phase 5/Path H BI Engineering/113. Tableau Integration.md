Canonical documentation for 113. Tableau Integration. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 113. Tableau Integration exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Tableau Integration exists to facilitate the seamless connection between various data sources and Tableau, a leading data visualization platform. The primary problem it addresses is the need for organizations to efficiently and effectively integrate their disparate data systems with Tableau, enabling data analysts and business users to easily access, analyze, and visualize data from multiple sources. This integration aims to reduce the complexity and time associated with data preparation, enhance data-driven decision-making, and improve overall business intelligence capabilities.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The Tableau Integration conceptual model involves several key components: data sources (such as databases, cloud storage, and big data platforms), connectors (which enable communication between data sources and Tableau), data preparation tools, and the Tableau platform itself. The integration process typically involves connecting to data sources, transforming and preparing the data, publishing the data to Tableau, and then visualizing and analyzing the data using Tableau's interactive dashboards and stories.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Data Source | A system or repository that stores data, such as a relational database, cloud storage, or big data platform. |
| Connector | A software component that enables communication between a data source and Tableau, facilitating data access and transfer. |
| Data Preparation | The process of transforming, cleaning, and formatting data to make it suitable for analysis and visualization in Tableau. |
| Tableau Server | A platform for publishing, sharing, and managing Tableau workbooks and data sources across an organization. |
| Visualization | The process of creating graphical representations of data to facilitate understanding, analysis, and decision-making. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Tableau Integration include data connectivity, data preparation, data publishing, and data visualization. Data connectivity involves establishing secure and reliable connections between data sources and Tableau using connectors. Data preparation is critical for ensuring that data is accurate, complete, and consistent, and involves tasks such as data cleaning, transformation, and aggregation. Data publishing involves making prepared data available to Tableau users, either by publishing data sources or workbooks to Tableau Server. Data visualization is the ultimate goal of Tableau Integration, enabling users to create interactive and dynamic dashboards that facilitate exploration, analysis, and insight generation.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Tableau Integration typically involves the following steps: (1) connecting to data sources using connectors, (2) preparing data using data preparation tools, (3) publishing data to Tableau Server, (4) creating visualizations and dashboards in Tableau, and (5) sharing and collaborating on insights with stakeholders. This model emphasizes the importance of data governance, security, and scalability, and recommends the use of best practices such as data validation, error handling, and performance optimization.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in Tableau Integration include the use of cloud-based data sources, such as Amazon Redshift or Google BigQuery, and the implementation of data warehouses or lakes to centralize and manage data. Another pattern is the use of data preparation tools, such as Tableau Prep or Alteryx, to streamline data processing and reduce manual effort. Additionally, many organizations adopt a self-service analytics approach, where business users are empowered to create their own visualizations and dashboards using Tableau, while IT provides governance and support.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in Tableau Integration include the use of outdated or unsupported connectors, which can lead to data inconsistencies and security vulnerabilities. Another anti-pattern is the failure to implement proper data governance and security measures, such as data encryption, access controls, and authentication. Additionally, over-reliance on manual data preparation and processing can lead to inefficiencies and errors, while neglecting to monitor and optimize performance can result in slow and unresponsive dashboards.
