## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 40. Compaction Strategies exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Compaction strategies are essential in various fields, including database management, file systems, and network protocols, to reduce storage requirements, improve data transfer efficiency, and enhance overall system performance. The primary purpose of compaction strategies is to eliminate redundant, obsolete, or unnecessary data, thereby minimizing storage capacity and optimizing resource utilization. The problem space addressed by compaction strategies includes data fragmentation, storage waste, and decreased system efficiency due to unnecessary data retention.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Compaction strategies involve a set of techniques and algorithms designed to reduce the size of data stored in a system, while preserving the integrity and accessibility of the data. This is achieved through various methods, such as data compression, deduplication, and rearrangement of data elements. The conceptual model of compaction strategies encompasses the identification of redundant or unnecessary data, the application of compaction algorithms, and the resulting optimized data storage.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Compaction | The process of reducing the size of data stored in a system, while preserving its integrity and accessibility. |
| Compression | A technique used to reduce the size of data by representing it in a more compact form. |
| Deduplication | A method of eliminating duplicate copies of data to reduce storage requirements. |
| Data Fragmentation | A condition where data is broken into smaller, non-contiguous pieces, leading to inefficient storage and retrieval. |
| Storage Optimization | The process of improving the efficiency of data storage, often through the use of compaction strategies. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of compaction strategies include:
* Data analysis: identifying redundant, obsolete, or unnecessary data
* Compaction algorithms: applying techniques such as compression, deduplication, and rearrangement to reduce data size
* Data integrity: ensuring that compacted data remains accessible and accurate
* Storage optimization: improving the efficiency of data storage through compaction

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for compaction strategies typically involves the following steps:
1. Data analysis and identification of redundant or unnecessary data
2. Selection of a suitable compaction algorithm
3. Application of the compaction algorithm to the identified data
4. Verification of data integrity and accessibility
5. Storage of the compacted data

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in compaction strategies include:
* Periodic compaction: scheduling regular compaction operations to maintain optimal storage efficiency
* Real-time compaction: applying compaction algorithms in real-time, as data is being written or updated
* Incremental compaction: compacting data in small, incremental steps, rather than in a single, large operation

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in compaction strategies include:
* Over-compaction: applying compaction algorithms too aggressively, resulting in data corruption or loss
* Under-compaction: failing to apply compaction algorithms frequently enough, resulting in inefficient storage
* Inconsistent compaction: applying different compaction algorithms or techniques inconsistently, leading to data inconsistencies
