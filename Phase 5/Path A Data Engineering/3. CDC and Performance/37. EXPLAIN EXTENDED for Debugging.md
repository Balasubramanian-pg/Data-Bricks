# 37. EXPLAIN EXTENDED for Debugging

Canonical documentation for 37. EXPLAIN EXTENDED for Debugging. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 37. EXPLAIN EXTENDED for Debugging exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The EXPLAIN EXTENDED statement is used for debugging and optimizing SQL queries. It provides detailed information about the execution plan of a query, including the order of operations, index usage, and estimated row counts. This helps developers identify performance bottlenecks and optimize their queries for better performance.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The EXPLAIN EXTENDED statement is a diagnostic tool that allows developers to analyze the execution plan of a SQL query. It provides a detailed, step-by-step breakdown of how the database will execute the query, including the algorithms used, the indexes accessed, and the estimated costs of each operation.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Execution Plan | A detailed, step-by-step description of how a database will execute a SQL query. |
| Index | A data structure used to improve the speed of data retrieval by providing a quick way to locate specific data. |
| Cost | An estimate of the resources required to execute a particular operation, such as CPU time, memory usage, or disk I/O. |
| Query Optimization | The process of analyzing and modifying a SQL query to improve its performance. |
| Database Engine | The software component responsible for executing SQL queries and managing database operations. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of EXPLAIN EXTENDED include:
* Understanding the execution plan of a query
* Identifying performance bottlenecks
* Optimizing queries for better performance
* Using indexes to improve data retrieval
* Analyzing estimated costs and resource usage

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for using EXPLAIN EXTENDED involves the following steps:
1. Write and execute a SQL query
2. Use the EXPLAIN EXTENDED statement to analyze the execution plan
3. Identify performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization
4. Modify the query to improve performance
5. Re-execute the query and re-analyze the execution plan using EXPLAIN EXTENDED

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for using EXPLAIN EXTENDED include:
* Using EXPLAIN EXTENDED to identify missing indexes
* Analyzing the execution plan to optimize join orders
* Using EXPLAIN EXTENDED to identify costly operations, such as full table scans
* Optimizing queries to reduce estimated costs and resource usage

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for using EXPLAIN EXTENDED include:
* Over-reliance on EXPLAIN EXTENDED, without considering other optimization techniques
* Failing to re-analyze the execution plan after modifying a query
* Ignoring estimated costs and resource usage when optimizing queries
* Using EXPLAIN EXTENDED as a substitute for proper query design and testing
