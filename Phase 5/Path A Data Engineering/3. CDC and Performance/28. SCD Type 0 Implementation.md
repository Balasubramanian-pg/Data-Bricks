# 28. SCD Type 0 Implementation

Canonical documentation for 28. SCD Type 0 Implementation. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 28. SCD Type 0 Implementation exists and the class of problems it addresses.
SCD Type 0 Implementation, also known as No History, is a type of Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD) implementation used in data warehousing to manage changes in dimension tables. It exists to address the problem of handling changes in dimension data, specifically when there is no need to maintain a history of changes. This approach is useful when the dimension data is relatively static, and changes are infrequent or do not require tracking.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The SCD Type 0 Implementation is based on the concept of overwriting existing data with new data when a change occurs. This approach assumes that the new data is the only relevant data, and there is no need to maintain a history of previous values. The SCD Type 0 Implementation is the simplest form of SCD and is often used for dimensions that are relatively small and do not change frequently.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| SCD | Slowly Changing Dimension, a dimension that changes over time, but at a slower rate than fact tables. |
| Type 0 | No History, a type of SCD implementation where changes are not tracked, and only the current value is stored. |
| Dimension Table | A table that stores descriptive data about a business entity, such as customer or product information. |
| Fact Table | A table that stores measurable data about a business process, such as sales or orders. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of SCD Type 0 Implementation include:
* Overwriting existing data with new data when a change occurs
* Not maintaining a history of changes
* Assuming the new data is the only relevant data
* Using this approach for dimensions that are relatively small and do not change frequently

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for SCD Type 0 Implementation involves the following steps:
1. Identify the dimension table that requires SCD Type 0 Implementation
2. Determine the columns that require updating when a change occurs
3. Create a process to overwrite the existing data with new data when a change occurs
4. Ensure data integrity by validating the new data before updating the dimension table

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for SCD Type 0 Implementation include:
* Using a simple update statement to overwrite existing data with new data
* Using a data integration tool, such as ETL (Extract, Transform, Load), to manage the update process
* Implementing data validation and error handling to ensure data integrity

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for SCD Type 0 Implementation include:
* Using SCD Type 0 Implementation for dimensions that change frequently or have a large number of rows
* Not validating new data before updating the dimension table
* Not implementing error handling to handle updates that fail
