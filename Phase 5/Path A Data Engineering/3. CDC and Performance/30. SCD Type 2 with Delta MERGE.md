# 30. SCD Type 2 with Delta MERGE

Canonical documentation for 30. SCD Type 2 with Delta MERGE. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 30. SCD Type 2 with Delta MERGE exists and the class of problems it addresses.
SCD Type 2 with Delta MERGE is a data warehousing technique used to manage slowly changing dimensions (SCDs) in a data warehouse. It exists to address the problem of tracking changes to dimension data over time, while also providing an efficient and scalable way to merge new data into the existing data set. The class of problems it addresses includes handling type 2 SCDs, which require tracking historical changes to dimension data, and performing delta merges to update the data warehouse with new data.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of SCD Type 2 with Delta MERGE involves a data warehouse with a fact table and one or more dimension tables. The dimension tables contain type 2 SCDs, which are updated using a delta merge process. The delta merge process involves identifying new and changed data, and then merging this data into the existing data set. The resulting data set contains a complete history of all changes to the dimension data, as well as the current state of the data.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| SCD | Slowly Changing Dimension, a dimension table that contains data that changes over time |
| Type 2 SCD | A type of SCD that tracks historical changes to dimension data by creating a new row for each change |
| Delta Merge | A process for updating a data warehouse with new data by identifying and merging only the changes |
| Fact Table | A table in a data warehouse that contains measurable data, such as sales or orders |
| Dimension Table | A table in a data warehouse that contains descriptive data, such as customer or product information |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of SCD Type 2 with Delta MERGE include:
* Type 2 SCDs: tracking historical changes to dimension data by creating a new row for each change
* Delta merge: updating a data warehouse with new data by identifying and merging only the changes
* Data warehouse architecture: designing a data warehouse to support SCD Type 2 with Delta MERGE, including fact and dimension tables
* Data integration: integrating new data into the existing data set using a delta merge process

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for SCD Type 2 with Delta MERGE involves the following components:
* A fact table that contains measurable data
* One or more dimension tables that contain descriptive data, including type 2 SCDs
* A delta merge process that updates the data warehouse with new data by identifying and merging only the changes
* A data warehouse architecture that supports the delta merge process and provides a scalable and efficient way to manage large amounts of data

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for SCD Type 2 with Delta MERGE include:
* Using a delta merge process to update the data warehouse with new data
* Implementing type 2 SCDs to track historical changes to dimension data
* Designing a data warehouse architecture that supports the delta merge process and provides a scalable and efficient way to manage large amounts of data
* Using data integration tools to integrate new data into the existing data set

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for SCD Type 2 with Delta MERGE include:
* Using a full merge process instead of a delta merge process, which can be inefficient and time-consuming
* Not implementing type 2 SCDs, which can make it difficult to track historical changes to dimension data
* Not designing a data warehouse architecture that supports the delta merge process, which can lead to performance and scalability issues
* Not using data integration tools to integrate new data into the existing data set, which can lead to data inconsistencies and errors
