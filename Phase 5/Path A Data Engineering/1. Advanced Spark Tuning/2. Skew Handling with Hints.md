> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 2. Skew Handling with Hints exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Skew handling with hints is a technique used to mitigate the effects of data skew in distributed systems, where certain nodes or partitions receive disproportionately large amounts of data, leading to performance bottlenecks and decreased overall system efficiency. The primary purpose of skew handling with hints is to provide a mechanism for identifying and addressing data skew, ensuring that data is distributed evenly across the system, and maintaining optimal performance.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of skew handling with hints involves a multi-step process: (1) data ingestion, (2) skew detection, (3) hint generation, and (4) data redistribution. This process is designed to be iterative, with continuous monitoring and adjustment to ensure that data is distributed optimally across the system.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Data Skew | A condition where certain nodes or partitions in a distributed system receive disproportionately large amounts of data, leading to performance bottlenecks. |
| Hint | A suggestion or recommendation provided to the system to guide the redistribution of data and mitigate the effects of skew. |
| Skew Detection | The process of identifying data skew in a distributed system, typically through monitoring and analysis of system performance metrics. |
| Data Redistribution | The process of rebalancing data across the system to ensure that it is distributed evenly and efficiently. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of skew handling with hints include: (1) data skew detection, (2) hint generation, and (3) data redistribution. These concepts are interconnected and interdependent, with each playing a critical role in the overall process of mitigating data skew and maintaining optimal system performance.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for skew handling with hints involves a combination of automated and manual processes. Automated processes are used for skew detection and hint generation, while manual processes are used for data redistribution and system tuning. This model is designed to provide a balance between efficiency and control, allowing system administrators to intervene and adjust the system as needed.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in skew handling with hints include: (1) periodic skew detection and hint generation, (2) automated data redistribution, and (3) manual system tuning and optimization. These patterns are designed to provide a consistent and reliable approach to mitigating data skew and maintaining optimal system performance.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in skew handling with hints include: (1) ignoring data skew or failing to implement skew detection and hint generation, (2) relying solely on manual processes for data redistribution and system tuning, and (3) using inadequate or insufficient hint generation algorithms. These anti-patterns can lead to decreased system performance, increased maintenance costs, and reduced overall efficiency.
