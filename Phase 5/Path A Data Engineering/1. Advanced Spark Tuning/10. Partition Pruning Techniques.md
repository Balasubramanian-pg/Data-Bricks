Canonical documentation for 10. Partition Pruning Techniques. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 10. Partition Pruning Techniques exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Partition Pruning Techniques exist to optimize the performance of database queries by reducing the amount of data that needs to be scanned. The class of problems it addresses includes improving query efficiency, reducing storage costs, and enhancing overall system scalability. By effectively pruning partitions, databases can minimize the number of partitions that need to be accessed, resulting in faster query execution times and improved system responsiveness.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Partition Pruning Techniques involve dividing large datasets into smaller, more manageable partitions based on specific criteria such as date, region, or customer segment. By applying pruning techniques, the database can eliminate partitions that do not contain relevant data, thereby reducing the amount of data that needs to be scanned. This process enables databases to focus on the most relevant data, resulting in improved query performance and reduced storage requirements.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Partition | A logical division of a large dataset into smaller, more manageable segments |
| Pruning | The process of eliminating partitions that do not contain relevant data |
| Partition Key | A column or set of columns used to determine the partitioning criteria |
| Partition Scheme | A predefined set of rules that govern how data is partitioned |
| Data Distribution | The way data is spread across multiple partitions |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Partition Pruning Techniques include:
* **Partitioning**: dividing data into smaller segments based on specific criteria
* **Pruning**: eliminating partitions that do not contain relevant data
* **Partition management**: managing the creation, maintenance, and optimization of partitions
* **Query optimization**: optimizing database queries to take advantage of partition pruning

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Partition Pruning Techniques involves the following steps:
1. **Data partitioning**: dividing data into smaller partitions based on specific criteria
2. **Partition pruning**: eliminating partitions that do not contain relevant data
3. **Query optimization**: optimizing database queries to take advantage of partition pruning
4. **Partition maintenance**: regularly maintaining and optimizing partitions to ensure optimal performance

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in Partition Pruning Techniques include:
* **Range-based partitioning**: partitioning data based on a specific range of values
* **List-based partitioning**: partitioning data based on a specific list of values
* **Hash-based partitioning**: partitioning data based on a hash function
* **Composite partitioning**: partitioning data based on multiple criteria

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in Partition Pruning Techniques include:
* **Over-partitioning**: creating too many partitions, resulting in increased overhead and decreased performance
* **Under-partitioning**: creating too few partitions, resulting in decreased query performance
* **Poor partition design**: designing partitions that do not align with query patterns, resulting in decreased query performance
