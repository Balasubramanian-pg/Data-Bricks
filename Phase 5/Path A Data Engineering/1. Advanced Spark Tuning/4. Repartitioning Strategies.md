## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 4. Repartitioning Strategies exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Repartitioning strategies are essential in various fields, including data storage, network architecture, and computational systems. The primary purpose of repartitioning strategies is to optimize the distribution of resources, data, or workload across multiple partitions, nodes, or systems. This is crucial in addressing problems such as data skew, load imbalance, and resource underutilization, which can significantly impact system performance, scalability, and reliability.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Repartitioning strategies involve a systematic approach to reorganizing and reallocating resources, data, or workload across multiple partitions or nodes. This process typically involves assessing the current state of the system, identifying areas of imbalance or inefficiency, and applying a set of algorithms or techniques to redistribute the resources, data, or workload in a more optimal manner. The goal is to achieve a more balanced and efficient distribution, which can lead to improved system performance, increased throughput, and enhanced reliability.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Repartitioning | The process of reorganizing and reallocating resources, data, or workload across multiple partitions or nodes. |
| Partition | A logical or physical division of a system, resource, or data set. |
| Data Skew | A condition where data is unevenly distributed across multiple partitions or nodes, leading to imbalance and inefficiency. |
| Load Balancing | The process of distributing workload across multiple nodes or systems to achieve optimal performance and minimize bottlenecks. |
| Resource Utilization | The extent to which system resources, such as CPU, memory, or storage, are being used efficiently. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of repartitioning strategies include:
* **Data distribution**: The process of allocating data across multiple partitions or nodes to achieve optimal storage and retrieval efficiency.
* **Load balancing**: The technique of distributing workload across multiple nodes or systems to minimize bottlenecks and optimize performance.
* **Resource allocation**: The process of assigning system resources, such as CPU, memory, or storage, to different partitions or nodes to achieve optimal utilization.
* **Partitioning algorithms**: The methods and techniques used to divide data, resources, or workload into smaller, more manageable partitions.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for repartitioning strategies typically involves the following steps:
1. **Assessment**: Evaluate the current state of the system, identifying areas of imbalance or inefficiency.
2. **Partitioning**: Apply a partitioning algorithm to divide the data, resources, or workload into smaller, more manageable partitions.
3. **Repartitioning**: Reallocate the resources, data, or workload across the partitions to achieve a more optimal distribution.
4. **Monitoring**: Continuously monitor the system to ensure the repartitioning strategy is effective and make adjustments as needed.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in repartitioning strategies include:
* **Horizontal partitioning**: Dividing data or workload across multiple nodes or systems to achieve scalability and improved performance.
* **Vertical partitioning**: Dividing data or workload into smaller, more specialized partitions to achieve improved efficiency and reduced latency.
* **Hybrid partitioning**: Combining horizontal and vertical partitioning techniques to achieve a balanced and optimal distribution.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in repartitioning strategies include:
* **Over-partitioning**: Creating too many partitions, leading to increased complexity and reduced performance.
* **Under-partitioning**: Creating too few partitions, leading to imbalance and inefficiency.
* **Static partitioning**: Failing to adapt or adjust the partitioning strategy in response to changing system conditions or requirements.
