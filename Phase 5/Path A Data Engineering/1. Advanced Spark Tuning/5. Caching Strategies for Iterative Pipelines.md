## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 5. Caching Strategies for Iterative Pipelines exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Caching strategies for iterative pipelines exist to optimize the performance and efficiency of data processing workflows. The primary problem addressed by caching strategies is the repeated computation of intermediate results, which can lead to significant increases in processing time, resource utilization, and energy consumption. By storing and reusing intermediate results, caching strategies can reduce the computational overhead of iterative pipelines, making them more scalable and responsive.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual model of caching strategies for iterative pipelines involves a layered architecture, where each layer represents a stage in the data processing workflow. Caching mechanisms are inserted between layers to store and retrieve intermediate results, reducing the need for redundant computations. The key components of this model include cache stores, cache invalidation policies, and cache optimization techniques.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Cache Hit | A successful retrieval of a cached result, avoiding redundant computation. |
| Cache Miss | A failed retrieval of a cached result, requiring redundant computation. |
| Cache Store | A repository for storing cached results, such as a memory buffer or disk storage. |
| Cache Invalidation Policy | A strategy for determining when to remove or update cached results, such as time-to-live (TTL) or least-recently-used (LRU). |
| Cache Optimization Technique | A method for improving cache performance, such as cache partitioning or cache prefetching. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of caching strategies for iterative pipelines include:
* **Cache locality**: The tendency of a pipeline to access recently computed results, making them more likely to be cached.
* **Cache coherence**: The consistency of cached results across multiple pipeline iterations, ensuring that changes to input data are properly propagated.
* **Cache capacity**: The limited storage space available for caching results, requiring efficient cache management and optimization techniques.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for caching strategies in iterative pipelines involves a hierarchical cache architecture, with multiple levels of caching and cache invalidation policies. This model includes:
* **Level 1 cache**: A small, fast cache for storing frequently accessed results.
* **Level 2 cache**: A larger, slower cache for storing less frequently accessed results.
* **Cache invalidation policy**: A strategy for determining when to remove or update cached results, such as TTL or LRU.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in caching strategies for iterative pipelines include:
* **Cache-aside**: A pattern where the cache is updated only when the underlying data changes.
* **Read-through**: A pattern where the cache is updated whenever data is read from the underlying storage.
* **Write-through**: A pattern where the cache is updated whenever data is written to the underlying storage.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in caching strategies for iterative pipelines include:
* **Over-caching**: Caching too many results, leading to cache thrashing and decreased performance.
* **Under-caching**: Caching too few results, leading to redundant computations and decreased performance.
* **Inconsistent cache invalidation**: Failing to properly invalidate cached results, leading to stale data and incorrect results.
