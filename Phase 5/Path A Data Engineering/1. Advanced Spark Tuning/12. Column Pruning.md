Canonical documentation for 12. Column Pruning. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 12. Column Pruning exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Column Pruning is a technique used in data preprocessing to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset by removing irrelevant or redundant features. It exists to address the problem of curse of dimensionality, where high-dimensional datasets can lead to decreased model performance, increased risk of overfitting, and higher computational costs. By pruning columns, data scientists and analysts can improve model accuracy, reduce noise, and enhance interpretability.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Column Pruning involves evaluating the importance of each feature in a dataset and selecting a subset of the most relevant features to retain. This process can be performed using various methods, including correlation analysis, mutual information, and recursive feature elimination. The goal is to preserve the most informative features while discarding those that do not contribute significantly to the model's performance.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Column | A single feature or variable in a dataset |
| Pruning | The process of removing or selecting a subset of columns from a dataset |
| Dimensionality | The number of features or columns in a dataset |
| Feature Importance | A measure of the contribution of each feature to the model's performance |
| Correlation Analysis | A method for evaluating the relationship between two or more features |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Column Pruning include:
* Feature selection: identifying the most relevant features to retain
* Feature ranking: assigning a score or ranking to each feature based on its importance
* Thresholding: setting a threshold to determine which features to retain or discard
* Evaluation metrics: using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall to evaluate the performance of the pruned dataset

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Column Pruning involves the following steps:
1. Data preprocessing: handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling/normalizing features
2. Feature importance calculation: using methods such as correlation analysis, mutual information, or recursive feature elimination to evaluate feature importance
3. Feature selection: selecting a subset of the most important features based on the calculated importance scores
4. Model training and evaluation: training a model on the pruned dataset and evaluating its performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in Column Pruning include:
* Using correlation analysis to identify highly correlated features and removing redundant features
* Using recursive feature elimination to iteratively remove the least important features
* Using mutual information to evaluate the relationship between features and the target variable
* Using dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA or t-SNE to reduce the number of features

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in Column Pruning include:
* Removing features without evaluating their importance
* Using a single feature importance method without considering other methods
* Not considering the relationships between features
* Not evaluating the performance of the pruned dataset
