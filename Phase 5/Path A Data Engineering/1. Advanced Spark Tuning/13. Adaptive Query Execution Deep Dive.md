## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 13. Adaptive Query Execution Deep Dive exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Adaptive Query Execution Deep Dive is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of adaptive query execution, a technique used in database systems to optimize query performance by dynamically adjusting the execution plan based on runtime conditions. The primary problem space addressed by this topic is the need for efficient and effective query execution in complex, dynamic environments where traditional static execution plans may not be optimal.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Adaptive query execution involves a feedback loop between the query execution engine and the runtime environment, allowing the system to monitor and adjust the execution plan in real-time. This approach enables the system to respond to changes in data distribution, query workload, and system resources, resulting in improved query performance and reduced latency.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Adaptive Query Execution | A technique used in database systems to dynamically adjust the execution plan of a query based on runtime conditions. |
| Execution Plan | A sequence of operations used to execute a query, including steps such as data retrieval, joining, and aggregation. |
| Query Optimization | The process of selecting the most efficient execution plan for a query, taking into account factors such as data distribution, query workload, and system resources. |
| Runtime Statistics | Data collected during query execution, used to monitor and adjust the execution plan. |
| Dynamic Re-Optimization | The process of re-evaluating and adjusting the execution plan during query execution, based on runtime statistics and changing conditions. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of adaptive query execution include:
* **Monitoring and Feedback**: The system continuously monitors query execution and collects runtime statistics, using this feedback to adjust the execution plan.
* **Dynamic Re-Optimization**: The system re-evaluates and adjusts the execution plan during query execution, based on changing conditions and runtime statistics.
* **Cost-Based Optimization**: The system uses cost-based optimization techniques to select the most efficient execution plan, taking into account factors such as data distribution, query workload, and system resources.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for adaptive query execution involves the following components:
* **Query Parser**: Responsible for parsing the query and generating an initial execution plan.
* **Query Optimizer**: Responsible for optimizing the execution plan, taking into account factors such as data distribution, query workload, and system resources.
* **Execution Engine**: Responsible for executing the query, using the optimized execution plan.
* **Runtime Monitor**: Responsible for collecting runtime statistics and monitoring query execution.
* **Re-Optimization Module**: Responsible for re-evaluating and adjusting the execution plan during query execution.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in adaptive query execution include:
* **Dynamic Partitioning**: Dividing data into smaller partitions, based on runtime statistics and query workload.
* **Index Selection**: Selecting the most efficient index, based on query workload and data distribution.
* **Join Reordering**: Reordering join operations, based on runtime statistics and query workload.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in adaptive query execution include:
* **Over-Optimization**: Spending too much time optimizing the execution plan, resulting in increased latency and decreased query performance.
* **Under-Optimization**: Failing to optimize the execution plan, resulting in suboptimal query performance.
* **Inadequate Monitoring**: Failing to collect sufficient runtime statistics, resulting in inadequate feedback and adjustment of the execution plan.
