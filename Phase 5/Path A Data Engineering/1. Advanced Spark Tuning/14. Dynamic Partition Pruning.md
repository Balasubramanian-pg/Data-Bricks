# 14. Dynamic Partition Pruning

Canonical documentation for 14. Dynamic Partition Pruning. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 14. Dynamic Partition Pruning exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Dynamic Partition Pruning exists to optimize the performance of big data processing and analytics systems by reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed. The class of problems it addresses includes improving query performance, reducing storage costs, and enhancing overall system efficiency. Dynamic Partition Pruning achieves this by dynamically eliminating partitions that do not contain relevant data, thereby minimizing the amount of data that needs to be scanned and processed.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Dynamic Partition Pruning is a technique used in big data processing and analytics systems to optimize query performance by dynamically pruning partitions that do not contain relevant data. It works by analyzing the query predicates and partitioning scheme to determine which partitions can be safely eliminated from the query processing pipeline. This approach enables the system to focus on processing only the relevant data, resulting in improved query performance, reduced storage costs, and enhanced overall system efficiency.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Partition | A logical division of a large dataset into smaller, more manageable pieces. |
| Partition Scheme | A definition of how data is divided into partitions, including the partitioning criteria and partition boundaries. |
| Query Predicate | A condition or filter applied to a query to restrict the data that is returned. |
| Pruning | The process of eliminating partitions that do not contain relevant data from the query processing pipeline. |
| Dynamic Pruning | The ability to prune partitions at runtime, based on the query predicates and partition scheme. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Dynamic Partition Pruning include:
* **Partitioning**: dividing a large dataset into smaller, more manageable pieces.
* **Query optimization**: analyzing query predicates and partition schemes to determine which partitions can be safely eliminated from the query processing pipeline.
* **Pruning**: eliminating partitions that do not contain relevant data from the query processing pipeline.
* **Dynamic pruning**: pruning partitions at runtime, based on the query predicates and partition scheme.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Dynamic Partition Pruning involves the following components:
* **Partitioning scheme**: a definition of how data is divided into partitions, including the partitioning criteria and partition boundaries.
* **Query optimizer**: a component that analyzes query predicates and partition schemes to determine which partitions can be safely eliminated from the query processing pipeline.
* **Pruning engine**: a component that eliminates partitions that do not contain relevant data from the query processing pipeline.
* **Runtime environment**: the environment in which the pruning engine operates, including the data processing and analytics system.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for Dynamic Partition Pruning include:
* **Range-based pruning**: pruning partitions based on range-based query predicates, such as date or numeric ranges.
* **List-based pruning**: pruning partitions based on list-based query predicates, such as lists of values or categories.
* **Composite pruning**: pruning partitions based on composite query predicates, such as combinations of range-based and list-based predicates.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for Dynamic Partition Pruning include:
* **Over-pruning**: pruning too many partitions, resulting in reduced query performance and increased storage costs.
* **Under-pruning**: pruning too few partitions, resulting in reduced query performance and increased storage costs.
* **Incorrect pruning**: pruning the wrong partitions, resulting in incorrect query results and reduced system efficiency.
