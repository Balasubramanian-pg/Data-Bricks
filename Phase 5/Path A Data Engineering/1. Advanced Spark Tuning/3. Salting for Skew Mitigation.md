Canonical documentation for 3. Salting for Skew Mitigation. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 3. Salting for Skew Mitigation exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Salting for skew mitigation is a technique used to reduce the impact of skewed data distributions on the performance and accuracy of various algorithms, particularly in the context of distributed computing and big data processing. Skew refers to the uneven distribution of data, which can lead to hotspots, increased latency, and decreased overall system efficiency. Salting helps to mitigate these issues by introducing a randomizing factor that redistributes the data, making it more balanced and reducing the likelihood of hotspots.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of salting for skew mitigation involves understanding the concept of data skew, its impact on system performance, and the role of salting in mitigating this issue. It requires a high-level understanding of data distribution, algorithmic performance, and system efficiency. The mental model should include the idea that salting introduces randomness to the data, which helps to redistribute it and reduce skew.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Salting | The process of introducing a randomizing factor to data to reduce skew and improve distribution. |
| Skew | The uneven distribution of data, which can lead to hotspots and decreased system efficiency. |
| Hotspot | A node or resource that receives a disproportionately large amount of data or traffic, leading to increased latency and decreased performance. |
| Data Distribution | The way in which data is spread across a system, which can be even (uniform) or uneven (skewed). |
| Randomizing Factor | A value or function that introduces randomness to the data, used to redistribute it and reduce skew. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of salting for skew mitigation include:
* Understanding the nature of data skew and its impact on system performance
* Recognizing the importance of data distribution and its effect on algorithmic performance
* Introducing randomness to the data through salting to reduce skew
* Understanding the trade-offs between salting and other techniques for mitigating skew

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for salting for skew mitigation involves the following steps:
1. Identify the source of skew in the data
2. Determine the appropriate salting technique (e.g., hash-based, random-based)
3. Apply the salting technique to the data
4. Monitor and adjust the salting technique as needed to achieve optimal results

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for salting for skew mitigation include:
* Using hash functions to introduce randomness to the data
* Applying salting to specific fields or columns in a dataset
* Combining salting with other techniques, such as data partitioning or caching

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for salting for skew mitigation include:
* Over-salting, which can lead to decreased performance and increased latency
* Under-salting, which can fail to effectively mitigate skew
* Using inadequate or poorly designed salting techniques
