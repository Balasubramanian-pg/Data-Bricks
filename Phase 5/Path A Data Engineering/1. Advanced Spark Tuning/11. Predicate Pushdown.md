# 11. Predicate Pushdown

Canonical documentation for 11. Predicate Pushdown. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 11. Predicate Pushdown exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Predicate Pushdown is a query optimization technique used in distributed databases and data processing systems to improve the efficiency of data retrieval. It exists to address the problem of reducing the amount of data that needs to be transferred and processed during query execution, thereby improving performance and reducing latency. The class of problems it addresses includes optimizing query performance, reducing network overhead, and improving data processing efficiency in distributed systems.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Predicate Pushdown is based on the concept of pushing down predicates, or filters, to the data source or storage layer, allowing the system to filter out irrelevant data before it is transferred or processed. This approach enables the system to reduce the amount of data that needs to be retrieved, processed, and transferred, resulting in improved query performance and reduced latency.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Predicate | A condition or filter applied to the data to select a subset of records |
| Pushdown | The act of moving the predicate to the data source or storage layer for filtering |
| Query Optimization | The process of improving the efficiency of query execution |
| Distributed Database | A database that stores data across multiple nodes or locations |
| Data Processing System | A system that processes and analyzes large datasets |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Predicate Pushdown include:
* **Predicate definition**: Defining the conditions or filters to be applied to the data
* **Pushdown mechanism**: The process of moving the predicate to the data source or storage layer
* **Data filtering**: The act of applying the predicate to the data to select a subset of records
* **Query optimization**: The process of improving the efficiency of query execution using Predicate Pushdown

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Predicate Pushdown involves the following steps:
1. **Query receipt**: The system receives a query from the user or application
2. **Predicate definition**: The system defines the predicate or filter to be applied to the data
3. **Pushdown**: The system pushes the predicate down to the data source or storage layer
4. **Data filtering**: The data source or storage layer applies the predicate to the data and filters out irrelevant records
5. **Data transfer**: The filtered data is transferred to the processing layer for further processing and analysis

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for Predicate Pushdown include:
* **Filtering on partition keys**: Pushing down predicates that filter on partition keys to reduce the amount of data that needs to be transferred and processed
* **Filtering on indexing columns**: Pushing down predicates that filter on indexing columns to improve query performance
* **Using materialized views**: Using materialized views to pre-compute and store filtered data to improve query performance

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for Predicate Pushdown include:
* **Not pushing down predicates**: Failing to push down predicates to the data source or storage layer, resulting in unnecessary data transfer and processing
* **Using inefficient predicates**: Using predicates that are not optimized for the data source or storage layer, resulting in poor query performance
* **Not maintaining statistics**: Failing to maintain up-to-date statistics on the data, resulting in poor query optimization and performance
