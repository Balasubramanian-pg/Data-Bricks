# 16. Bronze Layer Ingestion Patterns

Canonical documentation for 16. Bronze Layer Ingestion Patterns. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 16. Bronze Layer Ingestion Patterns exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The Bronze Layer Ingestion Patterns exist to provide a standardized approach to ingesting and processing data in a data warehouse, specifically in the bronze layer, which is the initial landing zone for raw, unprocessed data. This pattern addresses the class of problems related to data ingestion, processing, and storage, ensuring that data is handled efficiently, securely, and in a scalable manner.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The Bronze Layer Ingestion Patterns can be conceptualized as a series of steps that facilitate the ingestion, processing, and storage of raw data. This includes data ingestion from various sources, data quality checks, data transformation, and data loading into the bronze layer. The patterns ensure that data is properly handled, transformed, and made available for further processing and analysis.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Bronze Layer | The initial landing zone for raw, unprocessed data in a data warehouse |
| Data Ingestion | The process of collecting and transporting data from various sources to a target system |
| Data Processing | The process of transforming, aggregating, and analyzing data to extract insights and meaningful information |
| Data Quality | The measure of how well the data meets the requirements and expectations of the users and the system |
| ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) | A process used to extract data from multiple sources, transform the data into a standardized format, and load it into a target system |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Bronze Layer Ingestion Patterns include:
* Data ingestion from various sources, such as files, databases, and APIs
* Data quality checks to ensure data accuracy, completeness, and consistency
* Data transformation to convert data into a standardized format
* Data loading into the bronze layer for further processing and analysis
* Data security and governance to ensure data is properly protected and managed

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Bronze Layer Ingestion Patterns involves the following steps:
1. Data ingestion from various sources
2. Data quality checks to ensure data accuracy and completeness
3. Data transformation to convert data into a standardized format
4. Data loading into the bronze layer
5. Data processing and analysis to extract insights and meaningful information

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for Bronze Layer Ingestion Patterns include:
* Using a message queue, such as Apache Kafka, to handle high-volume data ingestion
* Implementing data quality checks using tools, such as Apache Beam or Apache Spark
* Using a data transformation tool, such as Apache NiFi, to convert data into a standardized format
* Loading data into a cloud-based data warehouse, such as Amazon Redshift or Google BigQuery

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for Bronze Layer Ingestion Patterns include:
* Ingesting data without proper quality checks, leading to data inconsistencies and errors
* Using a single, monolithic data ingestion process, which can lead to scalability issues and data bottlenecks
* Failing to implement proper data security and governance, leading to data breaches and unauthorized access
