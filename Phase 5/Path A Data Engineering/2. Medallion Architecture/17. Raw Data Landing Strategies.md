> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 17. Raw Data Landing Strategies exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of Raw Data Landing Strategies is to provide a structured approach to handling and processing raw, untransformed data from various sources, addressing the challenges of data ingestion, storage, and preparation for downstream analytics and processing. The problem space includes managing large volumes of raw data, ensuring data quality and integrity, and enabling efficient data processing and analysis.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Raw Data Landing Strategies involve a series of processes and techniques for collecting, storing, and preparing raw data for use in analytics, data science, and other applications. This includes data ingestion, data validation, data storage, and data processing, with the goal of creating a scalable, flexible, and maintainable data pipeline.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Raw Data | Unprocessed, untransformed data collected from various sources |
| Data Ingestion | The process of collecting and transporting data from sources to a target system |
| Data Landing Zone | A designated area for storing and processing raw data |
| Data Validation | The process of checking data for accuracy, completeness, and consistency |
| Data Processing | The process of transforming, aggregating, and analyzing raw data |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Raw Data Landing Strategies include:
* Data ingestion and collection
* Data storage and management
* Data validation and quality control
* Data processing and transformation
* Data governance and security

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Raw Data Landing Strategies involves the following components:
* Data sources: various systems, applications, and devices that generate raw data
* Data ingestion: tools and processes for collecting and transporting data
* Data landing zone: a designated area for storing and processing raw data
* Data processing: tools and processes for transforming, aggregating, and analyzing raw data
* Data storage: repositories for storing processed and transformed data

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in Raw Data Landing Strategies include:
* Using cloud-based data lakes for storing and processing raw data
* Implementing data validation and quality control checks to ensure data accuracy and completeness
* Using data processing frameworks and tools, such as Apache Spark or Apache Beam, for transforming and analyzing raw data
* Implementing data governance and security measures to protect sensitive data

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in Raw Data Landing Strategies include:
* Storing raw data in relational databases, which can lead to performance issues and data fragmentation
* Failing to implement data validation and quality control checks, which can result in poor data quality and accuracy
* Using proprietary data formats, which can limit data portability and interoperability
* Neglecting data governance and security measures, which can put sensitive data at risk
