# 25. Layer Transition Rules

Canonical documentation for 25. Layer Transition Rules. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 25. Layer Transition Rules exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The Layer Transition Rules exist to provide a standardized framework for managing the interactions and transitions between different layers of a system, application, or network. This addresses the class of problems related to ensuring consistency, reliability, and scalability in complex, multi-layered architectures. By establishing a set of rules for layer transitions, developers and architects can better design, implement, and maintain systems that are modular, flexible, and adaptable to changing requirements.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The Layer Transition Rules can be conceptualized as a set of guidelines that govern how data, control, or requests move from one layer to another within a system. This involves understanding the interfaces, protocols, and mechanisms that enable communication between layers, as well as the constraints and assumptions that underlie these interactions. The rules are designed to promote loose coupling, high cohesion, and clear separation of concerns, making it easier to develop, test, and evolve individual layers without compromising the overall system's integrity.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Layer | A logical or physical partition of a system, application, or network that provides a specific set of functions or services. |
| Transition | The process of moving data, control, or requests from one layer to another. |
| Interface | A defined boundary or contract that specifies how layers interact with each other. |
| Protocol | A set of rules or standards that govern the format, timing, and sequencing of interactions between layers. |
| Mechanism | A specific implementation or technique used to enable layer transitions, such as APIs, message queues, or shared memory. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Layer Transition Rules include:
- **Layering**: The organization of a system into distinct layers, each with its own responsibilities and interfaces.
- **Interface Definition**: The specification of how layers interact, including the data formats, protocols, and mechanisms used.
- **Transition Management**: The processes and rules that govern how data, control, or requests move between layers.
- **Coupling and Cohesion**: The principles of minimizing dependencies between layers (loose coupling) and maximizing the internal consistency and coherence of each layer (high cohesion).

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Layer Transition Rules involves a hierarchical or layered architecture, where each layer has a well-defined interface and interacts with adjacent layers through specified protocols and mechanisms. This model promotes a clear separation of concerns, scalability, and flexibility, as well as ease of maintenance and evolution. The standard model includes:
- **Presentation Layer**: Handles user interaction and presentation logic.
- **Application Layer**: Encapsulates the business logic and rules of the system.
- **Data Access Layer**: Manages data storage, retrieval, and manipulation.
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Provides underlying services such as networking, security, and hardware management.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in Layer Transition Rules include:
- **Request-Response Pattern**: A layer sends a request to another layer and waits for a response.
- **Event-Driven Pattern**: A layer publishes events or notifications that are consumed by other layers.
- **Data Streaming Pattern**: Layers exchange continuous streams of data.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in Layer Transition Rules include:
- **Tight Coupling**: Layers are heavily dependent on each other, making it difficult to change one layer without affecting others.
- **God Object**: A single layer or component that encapsulates too much functionality, leading to complexity and maintainability issues.
- **Spaghetti Code**: Layers are interconnected in a complex, unstructured manner, making it hard to understand or modify the system.
