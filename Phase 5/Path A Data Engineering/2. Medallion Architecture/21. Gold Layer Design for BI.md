# 21. Gold Layer Design for BI

Canonical documentation for 21. Gold Layer Design for BI. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
The Gold Layer Design for BI exists to provide a standardized approach to designing and implementing business intelligence (BI) solutions. It addresses the class of problems related to data integration, data quality, and data governance, which are critical to the success of BI initiatives. The Gold Layer Design for BI aims to provide a framework for designing and building a unified, enterprise-wide BI architecture that enables organizations to make data-driven decisions.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
The Gold Layer Design for BI is based on a layered architecture that consists of multiple tiers, each with its own specific function and responsibility. The layers include the source systems, data integration layer, data warehouse, data mart, and presentation layer. This architecture provides a scalable and flexible framework for designing and implementing BI solutions that meet the needs of various stakeholders.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Gold Layer | A standardized layer in the BI architecture that provides a unified view of enterprise data |
| Data Integration Layer | A layer responsible for extracting, transforming, and loading data from source systems into the data warehouse |
| Data Warehouse | A centralized repository that stores data from various source systems in a single, unified view |
| Data Mart | A subset of the data warehouse that contains a specific set of data tailored to meet the needs of a particular business unit or department |
| Presentation Layer | A layer responsible for presenting data to end-users through reports, dashboards, and other visualization tools |

## 4. Core Concepts
The Gold Layer Design for BI is based on several core concepts, including:
* Data standardization: Ensuring that data is standardized and consistent across the enterprise
* Data governance: Establishing policies and procedures for managing data quality, security, and access
* Data integration: Combining data from multiple source systems into a single, unified view
* Data warehousing: Storing data in a centralized repository for reporting and analysis
* Data visualization: Presenting data to end-users through reports, dashboards, and other visualization tools

## 5. Standard Model
The standard model for the Gold Layer Design for BI consists of the following layers:
1. Source Systems: These are the systems that generate the data used in the BI solution, such as ERP, CRM, and other operational systems.
2. Data Integration Layer: This layer is responsible for extracting, transforming, and loading data from the source systems into the data warehouse.
3. Data Warehouse: This is a centralized repository that stores data from various source systems in a single, unified view.
4. Data Mart: This is a subset of the data warehouse that contains a specific set of data tailored to meet the needs of a particular business unit or department.
5. Presentation Layer: This layer is responsible for presenting data to end-users through reports, dashboards, and other visualization tools.

## 6. Common Patterns
Some common patterns used in the Gold Layer Design for BI include:
* Star and snowflake schema designs for data warehousing
* ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) and ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) patterns for data integration
* OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) and data visualization tools for presenting data to end-users

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Some common anti-patterns to avoid in the Gold Layer Design for BI include:
* Not having a standardized approach to data integration and data governance
* Not having a clear understanding of the business requirements and needs of the end-users
* Not using a scalable and flexible architecture that can adapt to changing business needs
* Not providing adequate training and support to end-users
