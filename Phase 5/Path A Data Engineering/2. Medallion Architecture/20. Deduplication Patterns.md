# 20. Deduplication Patterns

Canonical documentation for 20. Deduplication Patterns. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 20. Deduplication Patterns exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Deduplication patterns exist to address the issue of data redundancy, which can lead to increased storage costs, slower data processing, and decreased data quality. The primary purpose of deduplication patterns is to eliminate duplicate data, reducing the overall volume of data and improving data efficiency. This is particularly important in big data analytics, data warehousing, and data integration, where large volumes of data are processed and stored.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual model of deduplication patterns involves identifying and removing duplicate data entities, while preserving the integrity and consistency of the remaining data. This process typically involves data profiling, data matching, and data merging. The goal is to create a unified view of the data, with each entity represented only once, while maintaining relationships and context.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Deduplication | The process of identifying and removing duplicate data entities. |
| Data Entity | A single, unique instance of data, such as a customer or product. |
| Data Attribute | A characteristic or feature of a data entity, such as name or address. |
| Data Matching | The process of identifying duplicate data entities based on their attributes. |
| Data Merging | The process of combining duplicate data entities into a single, unified entity. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of deduplication patterns include:
* **Data Quality**: Ensuring that the data is accurate, complete, and consistent.
* **Data Profiling**: Analyzing the data to identify patterns, relationships, and anomalies.
* **Data Matching**: Using algorithms and techniques to identify duplicate data entities.
* **Data Merging**: Combining duplicate data entities into a single, unified entity.
* **Data Governance**: Establishing policies and procedures to manage data quality and integrity.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for deduplication patterns involves the following steps:
1. **Data Ingestion**: Collecting and loading data from various sources.
2. **Data Profiling**: Analyzing the data to identify patterns, relationships, and anomalies.
3. **Data Matching**: Using algorithms and techniques to identify duplicate data entities.
4. **Data Merging**: Combining duplicate data entities into a single, unified entity.
5. **Data Quality**: Ensuring that the data is accurate, complete, and consistent.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common deduplication patterns include:
* **Exact Matching**: Identifying duplicate data entities based on exact matches of attributes.
* **Fuzzy Matching**: Identifying duplicate data entities based on approximate matches of attributes.
* **Rule-Based Matching**: Identifying duplicate data entities based on predefined rules and algorithms.
* **Machine Learning-Based Matching**: Identifying duplicate data entities using machine learning algorithms and techniques.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for deduplication include:
* **Over-Deduplication**: Removing too many data entities, resulting in data loss and decreased data quality.
* **Under-Deduplication**: Failing to remove enough duplicate data entities, resulting in decreased data efficiency.
* **Lack of Data Governance**: Failing to establish policies and procedures to manage data quality and integrity.
