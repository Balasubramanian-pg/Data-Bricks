## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 22. Gold Layer Design for ML exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The Gold Layer Design for ML exists to provide a standardized framework for designing and implementing machine learning (ML) systems that require high accuracy and reliability. The class of problems it addresses includes the need for a consistent and repeatable approach to ML model development, deployment, and maintenance. This is particularly important in applications where ML models are used to make critical decisions, such as in healthcare, finance, or autonomous vehicles.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The Gold Layer Design for ML is based on a layered architecture that separates the concerns of data preparation, model training, and model deployment. The gold layer refers to the highest level of quality and accuracy that can be achieved in an ML system. The conceptual overview of the Gold Layer Design for ML includes the following components: data ingestion, data processing, feature engineering, model training, model evaluation, and model deployment.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Gold Layer | The highest level of quality and accuracy that can be achieved in an ML system |
| ML Model | A mathematical representation of a system that can make predictions or take actions based on input data |
| Data Ingestion | The process of collecting and transporting data from various sources to a central location |
| Feature Engineering | The process of selecting and transforming raw data into features that are suitable for ML model training |
| Model Training | The process of using a dataset to train an ML model |
| Model Evaluation | The process of assessing the performance of an ML model using a separate dataset |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of the Gold Layer Design for ML include: 
* **Data Quality**: The accuracy, completeness, and consistency of the data used to train and deploy ML models.
* **Model Accuracy**: The ability of an ML model to make correct predictions or take correct actions.
* **Model Interpretability**: The ability to understand and explain the decisions made by an ML model.
* **Model Robustness**: The ability of an ML model to perform well in the presence of noise, outliers, or other forms of uncertainty.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for the Gold Layer Design for ML includes the following components: 
* **Data Layer**: Responsible for data ingestion, data processing, and data storage.
* **Feature Engineering Layer**: Responsible for feature selection, feature transformation, and feature storage.
* **Model Training Layer**: Responsible for model training, model evaluation, and model selection.
* **Model Deployment Layer**: Responsible for model deployment, model monitoring, and model maintenance.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in the Gold Layer Design for ML include: 
* **Data Pipeline**: A sequence of data processing steps that extract data from sources, transform the data into a suitable format, and load the data into a target system.
* **Model Ensemble**: A combination of multiple ML models that are trained on different datasets or using different algorithms.
* **Hyperparameter Tuning**: The process of adjusting the hyperparameters of an ML model to optimize its performance.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in the Gold Layer Design for ML include: 
* **Data Snooping**: The practice of using the same dataset for both model training and model evaluation.
* **Overfitting**: The practice of training an ML model on a dataset that is too small or too noisy.
* **Lack of Model Interpretability**: The failure to provide explanations or insights into the decisions made by an ML model.
