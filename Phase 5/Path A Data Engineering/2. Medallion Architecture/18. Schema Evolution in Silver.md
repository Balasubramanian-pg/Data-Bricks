# 18. Schema Evolution in Silver

Canonical documentation for 18. Schema Evolution in Silver. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 18. Schema Evolution in Silver exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Schema Evolution in Silver exists to address the challenges of modifying and adapting database schemas in response to changing business requirements, new data sources, or evolving data structures. The class of problems it addresses includes handling schema changes, data migration, and ensuring data consistency and integrity during the evolution process.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Schema Evolution in Silver involves a set of processes and techniques for managing changes to database schemas over time. This includes creating, modifying, and versioning schemas, as well as migrating data between different schema versions. The goal is to ensure that the schema remains consistent, scalable, and adaptable to changing requirements, while minimizing disruptions to applications and users.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Schema | A blueprint or structure that defines the organization and relationships of data in a database |
| Schema Evolution | The process of modifying and adapting a database schema in response to changing requirements or conditions |
| Versioning | The practice of assigning a unique identifier or version number to each schema change, allowing for tracking and management of different schema versions |
| Data Migration | The process of transferring data from one schema version to another, while preserving data integrity and consistency |
| Backward Compatibility | The ability of a new schema version to support and maintain existing applications and data, without requiring significant changes or modifications |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Schema Evolution in Silver include:
* **Schema versioning**: assigning a unique identifier to each schema change, allowing for tracking and management of different schema versions
* **Data migration**: transferring data from one schema version to another, while preserving data integrity and consistency
* **Backward compatibility**: ensuring that new schema versions support and maintain existing applications and data, without requiring significant changes or modifications
* **Schema validation**: verifying that schema changes are valid and consistent, before applying them to the database
* **Change management**: managing and coordinating schema changes, to minimize disruptions to applications and users

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Schema Evolution in Silver involves the following steps:
1. **Planning**: identifying the need for schema changes, and planning the evolution process
2. **Design**: creating a new schema version, and defining the changes and modifications required
3. **Validation**: verifying that the new schema version is valid and consistent
4. **Migration**: transferring data from the old schema version to the new one
5. **Deployment**: applying the new schema version to the database, and updating applications and users
6. **Monitoring**: tracking and monitoring the effects of the schema change, and making adjustments as needed

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in Schema Evolution in Silver include:
* **Incremental evolution**: making small, incremental changes to the schema, rather than large, sweeping changes
* **Version branching**: creating separate branches or versions of the schema, to support different applications or use cases
* **Data transformation**: transforming data from one format or structure to another, to support schema changes or evolution
* **Schema extension**: adding new tables, columns, or relationships to the schema, to support new data or applications

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in Schema Evolution in Silver include:
* **Big bang evolution**: making large, sweeping changes to the schema, without proper planning or testing
* **Schema duplication**: duplicating entire schemas, rather than creating new versions or branches
* **Data loss**: failing to migrate or transform data properly, resulting in data loss or corruption
* **Lack of validation**: failing to validate schema changes, resulting in inconsistencies or errors
