# 19. Data Cleansing in Silver Layer

Canonical documentation for 19. Data Cleansing in Silver Layer. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 19. Data Cleansing in Silver Layer exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The primary purpose of data cleansing in the silver layer is to ensure the quality and accuracy of data by identifying, correcting, and transforming inaccurate, incomplete, or inconsistent data into a more reliable and usable format. This process addresses a wide range of problems, including data inconsistencies, missing values, duplicates, and formatting issues, which can negatively impact data analysis, reporting, and decision-making.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Data cleansing in the silver layer involves a series of processes that work together to improve data quality. These processes include data profiling, data validation, data standardization, data matching, and data enrichment. The goal is to create a unified, consistent, and accurate view of the data, which can then be used to support business intelligence, analytics, and other data-driven initiatives.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Data Profiling | The process of analyzing data to identify patterns, trends, and relationships, as well as to detect anomalies and inconsistencies. |
| Data Validation | The process of checking data against a set of rules, constraints, or criteria to ensure that it is accurate, complete, and consistent. |
| Data Standardization | The process of transforming data into a standard format to ensure consistency and comparability across different systems, applications, or datasets. |
| Data Matching | The process of identifying and linking related data records or entities across different datasets or systems. |
| Data Enrichment | The process of adding new data or attributes to existing data to enhance its value, relevance, or usefulness. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of data cleansing in the silver layer include data quality, data governance, and data stewardship. Data quality refers to the accuracy, completeness, and consistency of the data, while data governance refers to the policies, procedures, and standards that govern data management and use. Data stewardship refers to the role of individuals or teams responsible for ensuring the quality, security, and integrity of the data.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for data cleansing in the silver layer typically involves the following steps: 
1. Data ingestion: collecting and loading data from various sources into a centralized repository.
2. Data profiling: analyzing data to identify patterns, trends, and relationships, as well as to detect anomalies and inconsistencies.
3. Data validation: checking data against a set of rules, constraints, or criteria to ensure that it is accurate, complete, and consistent.
4. Data standardization: transforming data into a standard format to ensure consistency and comparability.
5. Data matching: identifying and linking related data records or entities.
6. Data enrichment: adding new data or attributes to existing data to enhance its value, relevance, or usefulness.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in data cleansing include:
* Using data quality metrics to measure and track data accuracy, completeness, and consistency.
* Implementing data validation rules and constraints to ensure data integrity.
* Using data standardization techniques, such as data normalization and data transformation, to ensure consistency and comparability.
* Applying data matching algorithms and techniques to identify and link related data records or entities.
* Using data enrichment techniques, such as data appending and data aggregation, to add new data or attributes to existing data.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Common anti-patterns in data cleansing include:
* Ignoring data quality issues or assuming that they will resolve themselves.
* Using manual or ad-hoc data cleansing methods, which can be time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient.
* Failing to document data cleansing processes, rules, and decisions, which can lead to a lack of transparency and accountability.
* Not testing or validating data cleansing results, which can lead to inaccurate or incomplete data.
* Not continuously monitoring and maintaining data quality, which can lead to data degradation over time.
