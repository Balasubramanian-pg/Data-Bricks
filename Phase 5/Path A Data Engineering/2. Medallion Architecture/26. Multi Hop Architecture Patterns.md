# 26. Multi Hop Architecture Patterns

Canonical documentation for 26. Multi Hop Architecture Patterns. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 26. Multi Hop Architecture Patterns exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The Multi Hop Architecture Patterns exist to address the complexities of distributed systems, where a single request or transaction may need to traverse multiple nodes, services, or networks. This pattern aims to provide a scalable, flexible, and fault-tolerant architecture for such systems, enabling the efficient routing of requests and data between multiple hops. The class of problems it addresses includes network latency, packet loss, and service unavailability, which can significantly impact the performance and reliability of distributed systems.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The Multi Hop Architecture Patterns can be conceptualized as a series of interconnected nodes or services, where each node acts as a relay, forwarding requests or data to the next node in the sequence. This sequence of nodes forms a path or route, which can be static or dynamic, depending on the specific implementation. Each node may perform specific functions, such as data processing, filtering, or transformation, before forwarding the request or data to the next node.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Hop | A single node or service in the multi-hop architecture, responsible for receiving, processing, and forwarding requests or data. |
| Node | A physical or virtual entity that participates in the multi-hop architecture, providing specific functions or services. |
| Path | The sequence of nodes or hops that a request or data traverses from the source to the destination. |
| Route | The specific path or sequence of nodes that a request or data takes, which can be static or dynamic. |
| Request | A message or packet sent from a source node to a destination node, which may traverse multiple hops. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Multi Hop Architecture Patterns include:
* **Decoupling**: Each node or hop is decoupled from the others, allowing for independent scaling, maintenance, and evolution.
* **Asynchronous communication**: Nodes communicate with each other asynchronously, using protocols such as message queues, APIs, or event-driven architectures.
* **Routing and forwarding**: Each node is responsible for routing and forwarding requests or data to the next node in the sequence.
* **Error handling and recovery**: Mechanisms for detecting and recovering from errors, such as node failures or network partitions.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Multi Hop Architecture Patterns involves a sequence of nodes or hops, each with a specific function or service, connected by a communication protocol or interface. The model includes:
* **Source node**: The node that initiates the request or sends the data.
* **Intermediate nodes**: Nodes that receive, process, and forward the request or data.
* **Destination node**: The node that receives the final request or data.
* **Communication protocol**: The protocol used for communication between nodes, such as HTTP, TCP, or message queues.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in Multi Hop Architecture Patterns include:
* **Request-response pattern**: A node sends a request to the next node, which processes the request and returns a response.
* **Publish-subscribe pattern**: A node publishes a message or event, which is received by multiple nodes that have subscribed to the topic.
* **Pipeline pattern**: A sequence of nodes that process a request or data in a linear sequence, with each node performing a specific function.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in Multi Hop Architecture Patterns include:
* **Tight coupling**: Nodes are tightly coupled, making it difficult to scale, maintain, or evolve individual nodes.
* **Synchronous communication**: Nodes communicate synchronously, leading to blocking, deadlocks, or performance issues.
* **Single point of failure**: A single node or hop becomes a bottleneck or single point of failure, impacting the entire system.
