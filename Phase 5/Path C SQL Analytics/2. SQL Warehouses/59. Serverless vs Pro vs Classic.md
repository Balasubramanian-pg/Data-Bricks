# 59. Serverless vs Pro vs Classic

Canonical documentation for 59. Serverless vs Pro vs Classic. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 59. Serverless vs Pro vs Classic exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of this documentation is to provide a comprehensive comparison of Serverless, Pro, and Classic architectures, highlighting their strengths, weaknesses, and use cases. This topic addresses the class of problems related to choosing the most suitable architecture for a specific project or application, considering factors such as scalability, cost, performance, and maintenance.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The Serverless, Pro, and Classic architectures represent different approaches to designing and deploying applications. Serverless architectures focus on event-driven, scalable, and cost-effective solutions, while Pro architectures prioritize high-performance, reliability, and advanced features. Classic architectures, on the other hand, represent traditional, monolithic designs. Understanding the trade-offs between these architectures is crucial for making informed decisions about application design and deployment.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Serverless Architecture | An event-driven architecture that relies on third-party services to manage infrastructure and scaling |
| Pro Architecture | A high-performance architecture that prioritizes reliability, security, and advanced features |
| Classic Architecture | A traditional, monolithic architecture that is often characterized by a self-managed infrastructure |
| Scalability | The ability of an application to handle increased traffic or workload without compromising performance |
| Cost-Effectiveness | The ability of an application to minimize costs while maintaining performance and functionality |
