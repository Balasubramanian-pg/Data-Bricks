# 58. Cost Based Optimization

Canonical documentation for 58. Cost Based Optimization. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 58. Cost Based Optimization exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The primary purpose of Cost Based Optimization is to minimize the cost of executing a query or a set of queries while meeting the required performance and functionality constraints. It addresses the class of problems related to query optimization, where the goal is to find the most efficient execution plan for a given query, taking into account various factors such as CPU cost, I/O cost, memory usage, and network latency.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Cost Based Optimization is a query optimization technique that uses a cost model to estimate the cost of executing different query plans. The cost model takes into account various factors such as the number of rows to be processed, the number of I/O operations, the amount of memory required, and the CPU processing time. The optimizer uses this cost model to evaluate different query plans and selects the plan with the lowest estimated cost.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Cost Model | A mathematical model that estimates the cost of executing a query plan |
| Query Plan | A sequence of operations that are executed to retrieve data from a database |
| Optimizer | A component of a database management system that selects the most efficient query plan |
| Cost Factor | A parameter that affects the cost of executing a query plan, such as CPU cost or I/O cost |
| Query Optimization | The process of selecting the most efficient query plan to execute a query |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Cost Based Optimization include:
* Cost estimation: The process of estimating the cost of executing a query plan
* Query planning: The process of generating different query plans and evaluating their costs
* Plan selection: The process of selecting the query plan with the lowest estimated cost
* Cost factors: The parameters that affect the cost of executing a query plan, such as CPU cost, I/O cost, and memory usage

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Cost Based Optimization involves the following steps:
1. Query parsing: The query is parsed to identify the required operations
2. Query planning: Different query plans are generated and their costs are estimated
3. Plan selection: The query plan with the lowest estimated cost is selected
4. Plan execution: The selected query plan is executed to retrieve the required data

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in Cost Based Optimization include:
* Using indexes to reduce the cost of data retrieval
* Optimizing join operations to reduce the cost of data combination
* Using caching to reduce the cost of repeated queries
* Optimizing subqueries to reduce the cost of data retrieval

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in Cost Based Optimization include:
* Using unnecessary indexes, which can increase the cost of data insertion and update
* Using inefficient join operations, which can increase the cost of data combination
* Failing to optimize subqueries, which can increase the cost of data retrieval
* Ignoring the cost of data retrieval, which can lead to inefficient query plans
