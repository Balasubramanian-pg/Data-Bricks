> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 62. Interactive Dashboards with Parameters exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Interactive Dashboards with Parameters exist to provide users with a dynamic and customizable way to explore and analyze data. The primary problem space addressed by this topic is the need for flexible and interactive data visualization, enabling users to easily modify parameters and observe the impact on the data. This is particularly useful in business intelligence, data science, and other fields where data-driven decision-making is crucial.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of Interactive Dashboards with Parameters involves a user-centric approach, where the dashboard is designed to be intuitive and responsive to user input. The dashboard typically consists of multiple visualizations, such as charts, tables, and maps, which are connected to a set of parameters that can be adjusted by the user. These parameters can include filters, dropdown menus, sliders, and other interactive elements that allow users to customize the data display and explore different scenarios.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Dashboard | A visual representation of data, often including multiple charts, tables, and other visualizations. |
| Parameter | A variable or input that can be adjusted by the user to modify the data display. |
| Filter | A parameter that restricts the data displayed based on specific conditions. |
| Widget | A self-contained component of a dashboard, such as a chart or table. |
| Interactive Element | A component of a dashboard that allows user input, such as a dropdown menu or slider. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Interactive Dashboards with Parameters include:
* Data visualization: The use of visual representations to communicate data insights.
* Interactivity: The ability of the dashboard to respond to user input and modify the data display accordingly.
* Customization: The ability of users to adjust parameters and tailor the dashboard to their specific needs.
* Flexibility: The ability of the dashboard to adapt to different data sources, user roles, and use cases.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Interactive Dashboards with Parameters typically involves the following components:
* A data layer, which provides the underlying data for the dashboard.
* A visualization layer, which renders the data as charts, tables, and other visualizations.
* An interaction layer, which handles user input and modifies the data display accordingly.
* A presentation layer, which defines the layout and design of the dashboard.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in Interactive Dashboards with Parameters include:
* Using filters to restrict data based on specific conditions.
* Employing dropdown menus and sliders to provide users with easy-to-use interactive elements.
* Utilizing drill-down capabilities to allow users to explore detailed data.
* Incorporating dashboard themes and layouts to provide a consistent user experience.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in Interactive Dashboards with Parameters include:
* Overloading the dashboard with too many parameters and interactive elements.
* Failing to provide clear and concise documentation for users.
* Not testing the dashboard for usability and performance issues.
* Ignoring accessibility and security considerations.
