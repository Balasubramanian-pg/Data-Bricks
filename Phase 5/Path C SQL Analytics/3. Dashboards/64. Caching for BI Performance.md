Canonical documentation for 64. Caching for BI Performance. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 64. Caching for BI Performance exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Caching for BI Performance exists to improve the responsiveness and efficiency of Business Intelligence (BI) systems by reducing the time it takes to retrieve and process data. The class of problems it addresses includes slow query performance, high latency, and inadequate system resources, which can lead to a poor user experience and decreased productivity. By implementing caching mechanisms, BI systems can minimize the need to query underlying data sources, thereby enhancing overall system performance.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of caching for BI performance involves a multi-layered approach, where frequently accessed data is stored in a faster, more accessible location, reducing the need to query the underlying data source. This approach typically involves a combination of caching mechanisms, such as query caching, data caching, and result caching, which work together to optimize system performance.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Cache | A high-speed storage location that holds frequently accessed data or results. |
| Cache Hit | When the requested data is found in the cache, reducing the need to query the underlying data source. |
| Cache Miss | When the requested data is not found in the cache, requiring a query to the underlying data source. |
| Query Caching | A caching mechanism that stores the results of frequently executed queries. |
| Data Caching | A caching mechanism that stores frequently accessed data, reducing the need to query the underlying data source. |
| Result Caching | A caching mechanism that stores the results of complex calculations or queries. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of caching for BI performance include:
* **Cache invalidation**: The process of removing outdated or invalid data from the cache to ensure data freshness and accuracy.
* **Cache sizing**: The process of determining the optimal size of the cache to balance performance and resource utilization.
* **Cache placement**: The process of determining the optimal location of the cache in the system architecture to minimize latency and maximize performance.
* **Cache refresh**: The process of updating the cache with new or changed data to ensure data freshness and accuracy.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for caching in BI systems typically involves a hierarchical caching architecture, consisting of:
* **Level 1 cache**: A small, fast cache that stores frequently accessed data or results.
* **Level 2 cache**: A larger, slower cache that stores less frequently accessed data or results.
* **Level 3 cache**: A large, slow cache that stores infrequently accessed data or results.
This hierarchical approach allows for efficient use of system resources and optimizes performance by minimizing the number of cache misses.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in caching for BI performance include:
* **Query caching**: Caching the results of frequently executed queries to reduce the load on the underlying data source.
* **Data caching**: Caching frequently accessed data to reduce the need to query the underlying data source.
* **Result caching**: Caching the results of complex calculations or queries to reduce the load on the system.
* **Cache chaining**: Using multiple caches in a hierarchical or sequential manner to optimize performance and minimize cache misses.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in caching for BI performance include:
* **Over-caching**: Caching too much data, leading to increased memory usage and decreased system performance.
* **Under-caching**: Caching too little data, leading to increased cache misses and decreased system performance.
* **Incorrect cache sizing**: Failing to properly size the cache, leading to decreased performance and increased resource utilization.
* **Inadequate cache invalidation**: Failing to properly invalidate outdated or invalid data, leading to decreased data freshness and accuracy.
