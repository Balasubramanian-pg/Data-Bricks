Canonical documentation for 63. Alerts and Anomaly Detection. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 63. Alerts and Anomaly Detection exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of Alerts and Anomaly Detection is to identify and notify users of unusual patterns or trends in data that may indicate a problem or opportunity. This topic addresses the class of problems related to monitoring and detecting anomalies in complex systems, such as network security, financial transactions, and IoT sensor data. The goal is to provide timely and accurate alerts to enable prompt action and minimize potential damage or loss.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Alerts and Anomaly Detection involves the use of statistical models, machine learning algorithms, and data analysis techniques to identify patterns and anomalies in data. The process typically includes data collection, preprocessing, modeling, detection, and notification. The conceptual model consists of three primary components: data ingestion, anomaly detection, and alert generation.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Anomaly | A data point or pattern that deviates significantly from the expected norm |
| Alert | A notification generated in response to an detected anomaly |
| Threshold | A predefined value or range used to determine when an anomaly is significant enough to trigger an alert |
| False Positive | An alert generated in response to a non-anomalous event |
| False Negative | The failure to generate an alert in response to an actual anomaly |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Alerts and Anomaly Detection include:
* **Data quality**: The accuracy, completeness, and consistency of the data used for anomaly detection
* **Model selection**: The choice of statistical or machine learning model used to identify anomalies
* **Threshold setting**: The determination of the optimal threshold value or range to minimize false positives and false negatives
* **Notification strategies**: The methods used to notify users of detected anomalies, such as email, SMS, or dashboard alerts

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Alerts and Anomaly Detection typically involves the following steps:
1. Data collection and preprocessing
2. Model selection and training
3. Anomaly detection and scoring
4. Threshold application and alert generation
5. Notification and review

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in Alerts and Anomaly Detection include:
* **Batch processing**: Processing data in batches to detect anomalies and generate alerts
* **Real-time processing**: Processing data in real-time to detect anomalies and generate alerts as soon as possible
* **Hybrid approach**: Combining batch and real-time processing to achieve a balance between accuracy and timeliness

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in Alerts and Anomaly Detection include:
* **Over-reliance on thresholds**: Relying too heavily on predefined thresholds, which can lead to false positives and false negatives
* **Insufficient data quality checks**: Failing to ensure the accuracy, completeness, and consistency of the data used for anomaly detection
* **Inadequate model evaluation**: Failing to regularly evaluate and update the models used for anomaly detection
