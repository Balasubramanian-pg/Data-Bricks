Canonical documentation for 67. Aggregate Tables for BI. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 67. Aggregate Tables for BI exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Aggregate tables for Business Intelligence (BI) exist to optimize query performance and reduce the complexity of analytical queries. They address the problem of slow query execution times and high computational overhead associated with analyzing large datasets. By pre-aggregating data, aggregate tables enable faster data retrieval, improved data summarization, and enhanced decision-making capabilities.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual model of aggregate tables for BI involves creating a physical or virtual table that stores pre-aggregated data, typically at a higher level of granularity than the base data. This table is designed to support common analytical queries, such as grouping, filtering, and sorting. The aggregate table acts as a cache, reducing the need to query the underlying detailed data and improving overall system performance.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Aggregate Table | A physical or virtual table that stores pre-aggregated data to support analytical queries. |
| Base Table | The underlying table that contains the detailed data used to populate the aggregate table. |
| Grain | The level of granularity at which data is aggregated, such as daily, monthly, or quarterly. |
| Measure | A quantitative value, such as sales or revenue, that is aggregated and analyzed. |
| Dimension | A categorical value, such as region or product, that is used to filter or group data. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of aggregate tables for BI include:
* Data aggregation: The process of combining data from multiple rows into a single row, using functions such as SUM, AVG, or COUNT.
* Data summarization: The process of reducing detailed data into a more compact form, using techniques such as grouping or filtering.
* Query optimization: The process of improving query performance, using techniques such as indexing, caching, or pre-aggregation.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for aggregate tables involves creating a star or snowflake schema, with the aggregate table at the center. The aggregate table is populated with data from the base tables, using a combination of data aggregation and summarization techniques. The resulting table is optimized for query performance, with indexes and caching used to further improve performance.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for aggregate tables include:
* Using a single aggregate table to support multiple analytical queries.
* Creating multiple aggregate tables, each optimized for a specific query or use case.
* Using data warehousing or ETL tools to populate and manage aggregate tables.
* Implementing data refresh and update mechanisms to ensure data consistency and accuracy.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for aggregate tables include:
* Creating too many aggregate tables, leading to data redundancy and maintenance overhead.
* Using aggregate tables as a replacement for proper data modeling and normalization.
* Failing to optimize aggregate tables for query performance, leading to slow query execution times.
* Not implementing data governance and security measures, leading to data inconsistencies and security risks.
