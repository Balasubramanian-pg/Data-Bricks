# 66. SCD for Analytics Workloads

Canonical documentation for 66. SCD for Analytics Workloads. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 66. SCD for Analytics Workloads exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The primary purpose of 66. SCD for Analytics Workloads is to provide a standardized approach to designing and implementing Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD) tables in data warehouses, specifically for analytics workloads. The class of problems it addresses includes managing changes to dimension data over time, handling different types of changes (e.g., type 1, type 2, type 3), and ensuring data consistency and accuracy for analytics and reporting purposes.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of 66. SCD for Analytics Workloads involves understanding the key components and processes involved in designing and implementing SCD tables. This includes identifying the different types of changes that can occur in dimension data, determining the appropriate SCD type to use, and implementing the necessary data structures and processes to manage these changes.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| SCD | Slowly Changing Dimension, a dimension table that stores data that changes over time |
| Type 1 SCD | A type of SCD that overwrites the old value with the new value, losing historical data |
| Type 2 SCD | A type of SCD that creates a new row for each change, preserving historical data |
| Type 3 SCD | A type of SCD that adds a new column to store the changed value, preserving historical data |
| Dimension Table | A table that stores data about a specific entity or concept, used for analysis and reporting |
| Fact Table | A table that stores measurable data, used for analysis and reporting |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of 66. SCD for Analytics Workloads include understanding the different types of SCDs (type 1, type 2, type 3), designing and implementing SCD tables, managing changes to dimension data, and ensuring data consistency and accuracy. Additionally, it involves understanding the trade-offs between different SCD types, such as data storage and query performance.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for 66. SCD for Analytics Workloads involves using a combination of type 1 and type 2 SCDs to manage changes to dimension data. This approach involves using type 1 SCDs for attributes that rarely change and type 2 SCDs for attributes that frequently change. The model also involves implementing data structures and processes to manage the changes, such as using surrogate keys and effective dates.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for 66. SCD for Analytics Workloads include using a single SCD table for each dimension, using a separate table for each type of change (e.g., type 1, type 2), and using a standardized naming convention for SCD tables and columns. Additionally, it involves using data validation and data quality checks to ensure data consistency and accuracy.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for 66. SCD for Analytics Workloads include using a single SCD table for multiple dimensions, using a type 1 SCD for attributes that frequently change, and not implementing data validation and data quality checks. Additionally, it involves not using a standardized naming convention for SCD tables and columns, and not documenting the SCD design and implementation.
