# 65. Star Schema Design on Delta

Canonical documentation for 65. Star Schema Design on Delta. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 65. Star Schema Design on Delta exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The Star Schema Design on Delta exists to provide a standardized approach to designing data warehouses on Delta Lake, addressing the need for scalable, efficient, and flexible data storage and querying. The class of problems it addresses includes data warehousing, business intelligence, and data analytics, where large amounts of data need to be stored, processed, and queried.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The Star Schema Design on Delta is a data warehousing design pattern that combines the benefits of Delta Lake's scalable and efficient storage with the simplicity and flexibility of a star schema. It consists of a central fact table surrounded by dimension tables, where each dimension table is connected to the fact table through a foreign key.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Fact Table | A table that contains measurable data, such as sales or website traffic, and is used to store the core data of the data warehouse. |
| Dimension Table | A table that contains descriptive data, such as customer or product information, and is used to provide context to the fact table. |
| Star Schema | A data warehousing design pattern that consists of a central fact table surrounded by dimension tables, where each dimension table is connected to the fact table through a foreign key. |
| Delta Lake | A scalable and efficient storage solution that provides ACID transactions, data versioning, and other features for building reliable data pipelines. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of the Star Schema Design on Delta include:
* **Fact tables**: storing measurable data, such as sales or website traffic.
* **Dimension tables**: storing descriptive data, such as customer or product information.
* **Star schema**: a design pattern that combines fact and dimension tables to provide a simple and flexible data model.
* **Delta Lake**: a storage solution that provides scalable and efficient storage, ACID transactions, and data versioning.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for the Star Schema Design on Delta consists of:
* A central fact table that contains the core data of the data warehouse.
* Dimension tables that provide context to the fact table, such as customer, product, or date information.
* Foreign keys that connect each dimension table to the fact table.
* A Delta Lake storage solution that provides scalable and efficient storage, ACID transactions, and data versioning.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for the Star Schema Design on Delta include:
* **Snowflaking**: extending the star schema by adding additional dimension tables that are connected to the existing dimension tables.
* **Fact constellations**: using multiple fact tables to store different types of data, such as sales and website traffic.
* **Data marting**: creating a subset of the data warehouse that is optimized for a specific business area or department.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for the Star Schema Design on Delta include:
* **Over-normalization**: normalizing the data to the point where it becomes difficult to query and analyze.
* **Under-normalization**: failing to normalize the data, resulting in data redundancy and inconsistencies.
* **Using a single, large fact table**: using a single fact table to store all of the data, resulting in poor performance and scalability.
