# 48. Online vs Offline Feature Serving

Canonical documentation for 48. Online vs Offline Feature Serving. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 48. Online vs Offline Feature Serving exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of Online vs Offline Feature Serving is to provide a framework for deciding when to use online or offline feature serving in machine learning model deployment. The problem space revolves around the trade-offs between real-time data processing, model updates, and the latency requirements of various applications. Online feature serving is suitable for applications that require real-time data processing and model updates, such as recommender systems or fraud detection. In contrast, offline feature serving is more suitable for applications where data can be processed in batches, such as data warehousing or reporting.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Online vs Offline Feature Serving involves a decision-making process that considers the latency requirements, data freshness, and computational resources of a given application. The conceptual overview can be visualized as a spectrum, with online feature serving on one end, characterized by real-time data processing and model updates, and offline feature serving on the other end, characterized by batch processing and periodic model updates.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Online Feature Serving | The process of generating and serving features in real-time, often using streaming data and incremental model updates. |
| Offline Feature Serving | The process of generating and serving features in batches, often using historical data and periodic model updates. |
| Feature Store | A centralized repository that stores and manages features, providing a single source of truth for feature data. |
| Model Serving | The process of deploying and managing machine learning models in production environments. |
| Latency | The delay between the time data is generated and the time it is processed and made available for use. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Online vs Offline Feature Serving include:
* **Data Freshness**: The importance of using up-to-date data in model training and inference.
* **Latency Requirements**: The need to balance latency with computational resources and data freshness.
* **Model Updates**: The process of updating models in response to changing data distributions or concept drift.
* **Feature Engineering**: The process of selecting and transforming raw data into features that are useful for modeling.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Online vs Offline Feature Serving involves a hybrid approach that combines the benefits of both online and offline feature serving. This approach typically involves:
* **Online Feature Serving**: Used for applications that require real-time data processing and model updates.
* **Offline Feature Serving**: Used for applications where data can be processed in batches, and model updates can be periodic.
* **Feature Store**: Used as a centralized repository to store and manage features, providing a single source of truth for feature data.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in Online vs Offline Feature Serving include:
* **Real-time Data Processing**: Using online feature serving for applications that require real-time data processing, such as recommender systems or fraud detection.
* **Batch Processing**: Using offline feature serving for applications where data can be processed in batches, such as data warehousing or reporting.
* **Hybrid Approach**: Combining online and offline feature serving to balance latency requirements with computational resources and data freshness.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in Online vs Offline Feature Serving include:
* **Using Online Feature Serving for Batch Processing**: This can lead to unnecessary computational overhead and latency.
* **Using Offline Feature Serving for Real-time Applications**: This can lead to stale data and poor model performance.
* **Not Using a Feature Store**: This can lead to data inconsistencies and difficulties in managing features across multiple applications.
