# 47. Reusable Versioned Features

Canonical documentation for 47. Reusable Versioned Features. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 47. Reusable Versioned Features exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The primary purpose of Reusable Versioned Features is to provide a framework for managing and deploying features in a scalable, maintainable, and efficient manner. This approach addresses the problems of feature duplication, version conflicts, and the complexity of managing multiple feature variants across different environments and applications. By providing a standardized way to design, implement, and manage features, Reusable Versioned Features enables organizations to reduce development costs, improve quality, and increase the speed of feature delivery.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Reusable Versioned Features is based on the concept of modular, independent, and versioned features that can be easily composed, reused, and managed across different applications and environments. This approach involves designing features as self-contained modules with well-defined interfaces, which can be easily integrated, updated, or replaced without affecting other parts of the system. The versioning aspect allows for multiple variants of a feature to coexist, enabling experimentation, A/B testing, and gradual rollout of new features.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Feature | A self-contained module that provides a specific functionality or capability. |
| Version | A unique identifier for a specific implementation of a feature. |
| Variant | A specific implementation of a feature, which may differ from other variants in terms of functionality, configuration, or behavior. |
| Module | A self-contained unit of code that implements a feature or a set of features. |
| Interface | A defined contract or API that specifies how a feature or module interacts with other parts of the system. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Reusable Versioned Features include:
* **Modularity**: Features are designed as independent modules with well-defined interfaces.
* **Versioning**: Features have unique version identifiers, which enable multiple variants to coexist.
* **Reusability**: Features are designed to be reusable across different applications and environments.
* **Composability**: Features can be easily composed and integrated with other features and modules.
* **Manageability**: Features are designed to be easily managed, updated, and replaced.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Reusable Versioned Features involves the following components:
* **Feature Registry**: A centralized repository that stores information about available features, including their versions, variants, and dependencies.
* **Feature Repository**: A version-controlled repository that stores the implementation of features, including their code, configuration, and documentation.
* **Feature Manager**: A component that manages the lifecycle of features, including deployment, updates, and removal.
* **Feature Interface**: A defined contract or API that specifies how features interact with other parts of the system.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for Reusable Versioned Features include:
* **Feature Flagging**: Using feature flags to enable or disable features in different environments or applications.
* **A/B Testing**: Using multiple variants of a feature to test and compare their effectiveness.
* **Canary Releases**: Gradually rolling out new features or variants to a subset of users or environments.
* **Blue-Green Deployments**: Deploying new features or variants in parallel with existing ones, and then switching to the new version.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for Reusable Versioned Features include:
* **Feature Duplication**: Implementing multiple copies of the same feature, which can lead to maintenance and consistency issues.
* **Version Conflicts**: Failing to manage version dependencies and conflicts, which can lead to errors and instability.
* **Tight Coupling**: Implementing features that are tightly coupled to specific applications or environments, which can limit their reusability and flexibility.
