> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 49. Point in Time Correctness exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of Point in Time Correctness is to ensure that data is accurate and consistent at a specific point in time, addressing issues related to data inconsistencies, inaccuracies, and inconsistencies due to temporal changes. This concept is crucial in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and governance, where data accuracy and reliability are paramount. Point in Time Correctness exists to mitigate the problems associated with data drift, inconsistencies, and errors that can occur over time, providing a snapshot of data at a specific moment.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Point in Time Correctness revolves around the idea of capturing data at a specific instant, ensuring that it reflects the true state of affairs at that particular moment. This concept involves understanding the temporal aspects of data, including the time of data creation, modification, and retrieval. It requires a deep understanding of data lineage, provenance, and versioning to accurately determine the state of data at a given point in time.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Point in Time | A specific instant in time, often used as a reference point for data accuracy and consistency. |
| Data Snapshot | A collection of data at a specific point in time, representing the state of affairs at that moment. |
| Temporal Consistency | The ability to maintain data consistency across different points in time, ensuring that data remains accurate and reliable. |
| Data Lineage | The record of data origin, modifications, and movements over time, providing a clear understanding of data provenance. |
| Data Provenance | The documentation of data history, including its creation, modification, and ownership, ensuring transparency and trust. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Point in Time Correctness include:
* **Temporal awareness**: Understanding the temporal aspects of data, including creation, modification, and retrieval times.
* **Data versioning**: Maintaining a record of changes to data over time, ensuring that each version is accurately represented.
* **Data lineage**: Tracking the origin, modifications, and movements of data to ensure transparency and trust.
* **Data provenance**: Documenting the history of data, including its creation, modification, and ownership.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Point in Time Correctness involves:
1. **Data collection**: Gathering data from various sources, ensuring that each piece of data is timestamped and versioned.
2. **Data processing**: Processing data to ensure consistency and accuracy, using techniques such as data validation and data normalization.
3. **Data storage**: Storing data in a way that preserves its temporal context, using data structures such as temporal databases or version-controlled repositories.
4. **Data retrieval**: Retrieving data at a specific point in time, using techniques such as temporal querying or data snapshotting.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for achieving Point in Time Correctness include:
* **Temporal data warehousing**: Storing data in a temporal data warehouse, allowing for efficient querying and analysis of data at different points in time.
* **Data snapshotting**: Creating periodic snapshots of data, providing a record of data at specific points in time.
* **Version-controlled data storage**: Storing data in a version-controlled repository, ensuring that each version of data is accurately represented and retrievable.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for Point in Time Correctness include:
* **Ignoring temporal context**: Failing to consider the temporal aspects of data, leading to inconsistencies and inaccuracies.
* **Overwriting data**: Overwriting existing data without maintaining a record of changes, making it difficult to determine the state of data at a specific point in time.
* **Lack of data versioning**: Failing to maintain a record of changes to data, making it challenging to ensure data consistency and accuracy.
