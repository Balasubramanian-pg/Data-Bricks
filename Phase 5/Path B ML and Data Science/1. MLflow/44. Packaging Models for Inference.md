Canonical documentation for 44. Packaging Models for Inference. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 44. Packaging Models for Inference exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of packaging models for inference is to enable the deployment of trained machine learning models in a production-ready environment, ensuring efficient, scalable, and reliable execution. This addresses the problem of model serving, where trained models need to be integrated with larger applications, services, or systems, requiring a standardized and efficient way to package and deploy them.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual model of packaging models for inference involves treating a trained model as a self-contained artifact that can be easily deployed and executed in various environments. This includes model serialization, containerization, and integration with inference engines or serving systems, allowing for seamless model deployment and management.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Model Packaging | The process of preparing a trained model for deployment by wrapping it in a container or format that can be easily executed in a production environment. |
| Inference Engine | A software component responsible for executing a packaged model, providing predictions or outputs based on input data. |
| Model Serving | The process of deploying and managing packaged models in a production environment, ensuring scalability, reliability, and performance. |
| Containerization | The process of packaging a model and its dependencies into a self-contained container, such as a Docker container, for easy deployment and execution. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of packaging models for inference include model serialization, containerization, and integration with inference engines or serving systems. Model serialization involves converting a trained model into a format that can be easily stored and transmitted, such as TensorFlow's SavedModel or PyTorch's TorchScript. Containerization involves packaging the serialized model and its dependencies into a self-contained container, ensuring easy deployment and execution. Integration with inference engines or serving systems enables the packaged model to be executed and managed in a production environment.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for packaging models for inference involves using a containerization platform, such as Docker, to package the trained model and its dependencies into a self-contained container. The container is then deployed to a production environment, where it is executed by an inference engine or serving system, such as TensorFlow Serving or AWS SageMaker.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for packaging models for inference include using containerization platforms, such as Docker, to package models and their dependencies, and using inference engines or serving systems, such as TensorFlow Serving or AWS SageMaker, to execute and manage packaged models. Another common pattern is to use model serialization formats, such as TensorFlow's SavedModel or PyTorch's TorchScript, to convert trained models into a format that can be easily deployed and executed.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Common anti-patterns for packaging models for inference include not using containerization, resulting in models being tightly coupled to specific environments or dependencies, and not using standardized model serialization formats, resulting in models being difficult to deploy and execute. Another anti-pattern is to not use inference engines or serving systems, resulting in models being executed and managed manually, which can be error-prone and inefficient.
