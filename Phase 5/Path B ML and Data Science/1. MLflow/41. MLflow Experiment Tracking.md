# 41. MLflow Experiment Tracking

Canonical documentation for 41. MLflow Experiment Tracking. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 41. MLflow Experiment Tracking exists and the class of problems it addresses.
MLflow Experiment Tracking exists to provide a standardized framework for managing and tracking machine learning experiments. The class of problems it addresses includes experiment reproducibility, comparison, and optimization. Without a standardized tracking system, machine learning experiments can be difficult to reproduce, compare, and optimize, leading to inefficiencies and wasted resources.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
MLflow Experiment Tracking is a component of the MLflow platform that enables data scientists and engineers to track and manage machine learning experiments. It provides a centralized repository for storing and retrieving experiment metadata, such as hyperparameters, metrics, and artifacts. This allows users to compare and contrast different experiments, identify trends and patterns, and optimize their machine learning workflows.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Experiment | A single execution of a machine learning model with a specific set of hyperparameters and input data. |
| Run | An individual execution of an experiment, which can be repeated multiple times with different hyperparameters or input data. |
| Hyperparameter | A parameter that is set before training a machine learning model, such as learning rate or batch size. |
| Metric | A quantitative measure of a machine learning model's performance, such as accuracy or loss. |
| Artifact | A file or object that is produced during an experiment, such as a trained model or a plot of the results. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of MLflow Experiment Tracking include:
* **Experiment management**: The ability to create, manage, and track multiple experiments with different hyperparameters and input data.
* **Run management**: The ability to manage and track individual runs within an experiment, including hyperparameters, metrics, and artifacts.
* **Metadata management**: The ability to store and retrieve metadata associated with experiments and runs, such as hyperparameters, metrics, and artifacts.
* **Comparison and optimization**: The ability to compare and contrast different experiments and runs, and optimize machine learning workflows based on the results.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for MLflow Experiment Tracking involves the following components:
* **MLflow server**: A centralized server that stores and manages experiment metadata, such as hyperparameters, metrics, and artifacts.
* **MLflow client**: A client-side library that interacts with the MLflow server to create, manage, and track experiments and runs.
* **Experiment repository**: A repository that stores and manages experiment metadata, such as hyperparameters, metrics, and artifacts.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in MLflow Experiment Tracking include:
* **Hyperparameter tuning**: Using MLflow Experiment Tracking to tune hyperparameters and optimize machine learning models.
* **Model selection**: Using MLflow Experiment Tracking to compare and contrast different machine learning models and select the best one for a given task.
* **Experiment reproducibility**: Using MLflow Experiment Tracking to reproduce and verify the results of machine learning experiments.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in MLflow Experiment Tracking include:
* **Manual tracking**: Manually tracking experiment metadata, such as hyperparameters and metrics, using spreadsheets or other ad-hoc methods.
* **Lack of standardization**: Failing to standardize experiment metadata, such as hyperparameters and metrics, across different experiments and runs.
* **Insufficient documentation**: Failing to document experiment metadata, such as hyperparameters and metrics, and other relevant information.
