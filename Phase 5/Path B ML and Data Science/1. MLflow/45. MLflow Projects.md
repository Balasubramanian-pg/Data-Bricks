# 45. MLflow Projects

Canonical documentation for 45. MLflow Projects. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 45. MLflow Projects exists and the class of problems it addresses.
MLflow Projects is a component of the MLflow framework that enables data scientists to manage and reproduce complex data science workflows. It addresses the problem of reproducibility, collaboration, and deployment of machine learning models by providing a standardized way to package and execute data science code. The primary goal of MLflow Projects is to simplify the process of developing, testing, and deploying machine learning models, making it easier to collaborate and reproduce results.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
MLflow Projects provides a high-level abstraction for managing data science workflows, allowing users to define and execute projects using a simple and intuitive interface. A project is defined as a directory containing a `MLproject` file, which specifies the project's dependencies, parameters, and entry points. This abstraction enables users to focus on developing their models, rather than worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| MLproject | A file that defines an MLflow Project, specifying its dependencies, parameters, and entry points. |
| Project | A directory containing an `MLproject` file, which defines a self-contained data science workflow. |
| Entry Point | A Python function or script that serves as the entry point for an MLflow Project. |
| Parameter | A configurable value that can be passed to an MLflow Project, allowing for customization and experimentation. |
| Dependency | A library or package required by an MLflow Project, which is automatically installed and managed by MLflow. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of MLflow Projects include:
* **Projects**: Self-contained directories that define a data science workflow, including dependencies, parameters, and entry points.
* **Entry Points**: Python functions or scripts that serve as the entry point for an MLflow Project, allowing users to execute the project.
* **Parameters**: Configurable values that can be passed to an MLflow Project, enabling customization and experimentation.
* **Dependencies**: Libraries or packages required by an MLflow Project, which are automatically installed and managed by MLflow.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for MLflow Projects involves defining a project using an `MLproject` file, which specifies the project's dependencies, parameters, and entry points. The project is then executed using the `mlflow run` command, which automatically installs dependencies, sets up the environment, and runs the specified entry point.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for using MLflow Projects include:
* **Experimentation**: Using MLflow Projects to define and execute experiments, allowing for easy comparison and reproduction of results.
* **Collaboration**: Sharing MLflow Projects with colleagues, enabling seamless collaboration and reproduction of results.
* **Deployment**: Using MLflow Projects to deploy models to production environments, such as cloud platforms or containerized applications.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for using MLflow Projects include:
* **Hardcoding dependencies**: Failing to specify dependencies in the `MLproject` file, leading to reproducibility issues and environment-specific problems.
* **Ignoring parameters**: Not using parameters to customize and experiment with MLflow Projects, limiting their flexibility and reusability.
* **Not testing projects**: Failing to test MLflow Projects thoroughly, leading to errors and inconsistencies in production environments.
