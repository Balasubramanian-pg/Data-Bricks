# 42. Model Registry Staging and Prod

Canonical documentation for 42. Model Registry Staging and Prod. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 42. Model Registry Staging and Prod exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The Model Registry Staging and Prod is designed to manage and deploy machine learning models in a controlled and scalable manner. It addresses the problems of model versioning, testing, and deployment, ensuring that models are properly validated and updated before being pushed to production. This registry provides a centralized location for model management, enabling data scientists and engineers to collaborate and track changes to models over time.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The Model Registry Staging and Prod consists of two primary environments: Staging and Production. The Staging environment serves as a testing ground for new models, allowing data scientists to validate and refine their models before deploying them to Production. The Production environment, on the other hand, is the live environment where deployed models are used to make predictions and drive business decisions. The registry provides a workflow that enables seamless transition of models from Staging to Production, ensuring that models are properly tested, validated, and updated.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Model | A mathematical representation of a system, process, or relationship, used to make predictions or drive business decisions. |
| Registry | A centralized location for managing and deploying models. |
| Staging Environment | A testing ground for new models, where data scientists can validate and refine their models before deploying them to Production. |
| Production Environment | The live environment where deployed models are used to make predictions and drive business decisions. |
| Model Versioning | The process of tracking changes to models over time, enabling data scientists to collaborate and manage different versions of models. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of the Model Registry Staging and Prod include model versioning, environment management, and workflow automation. Model versioning enables data scientists to track changes to models over time, collaborate on model development, and manage different versions of models. Environment management provides a clear separation between the Staging and Production environments, ensuring that models are properly tested and validated before being deployed to Production. Workflow automation enables seamless transition of models from Staging to Production, reducing the risk of errors and ensuring that models are properly updated.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for the Model Registry Staging and Prod consists of the following components:
* Model Registry: A centralized location for managing and deploying models.
* Staging Environment: A testing ground for new models, where data scientists can validate and refine their models before deploying them to Production.
* Production Environment: The live environment where deployed models are used to make predictions and drive business decisions.
* Workflow Automation: A automated process that enables seamless transition of models from Staging to Production.
* Model Versioning: A system for tracking changes to models over time, enabling data scientists to collaborate and manage different versions of models.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for the Model Registry Staging and Prod include:
* Model development and testing in the Staging environment.
* Model validation and refinement in the Staging environment.
* Automated deployment of models from Staging to Production.
* Continuous monitoring and updating of models in Production.
* Collaboration and versioning of models using the Model Registry.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for the Model Registry Staging and Prod include:
* Deploying models directly to Production without proper testing and validation.
* Failing to track changes to models over time, leading to versioning conflicts and collaboration challenges.
* Not separating the Staging and Production environments, leading to errors and inconsistencies.
* Not automating the workflow, leading to manual errors and delays.
* Not continuously monitoring and updating models in Production, leading to model drift and decreased performance.
