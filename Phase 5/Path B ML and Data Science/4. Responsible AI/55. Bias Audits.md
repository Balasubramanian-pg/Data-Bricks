Canonical documentation for 55. Bias Audits. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 55. Bias Audits exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Bias audits are a crucial process in identifying and mitigating biases in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) systems. The primary purpose of bias audits is to ensure that these systems are fair, transparent, and unbiased, thereby preventing potential harm to individuals or groups. The problem space addressed by bias audits includes issues such as discriminatory outcomes, unfair treatment, and lack of representation in datasets.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
A bias audit is a systematic examination of an AI or ML system to identify potential biases and errors. This process involves a comprehensive review of the system's data, algorithms, and decision-making processes to detect any discriminatory patterns or behaviors. The goal of a bias audit is to provide a thorough understanding of the system's limitations and potential biases, enabling developers to take corrective actions to mitigate these issues.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Bias | A systematic error or distortion in an AI or ML system that results in unfair or discriminatory outcomes. |
| Fairness | The ability of an AI or ML system to produce outcomes that are free from bias and discrimination. |
| Transparency | The ability of an AI or ML system to provide clear and understandable explanations for its decisions and actions. |
| Audit | A systematic examination and evaluation of an AI or ML system to identify potential biases and errors. |
| Mitigation | The process of taking corrective actions to reduce or eliminate biases and errors in an AI or ML system. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of bias audits include:
* **Data quality**: The accuracy, completeness, and representativeness of the data used to train and test AI and ML systems.
* **Algorithmic fairness**: The ability of an AI or ML system to produce outcomes that are fair and unbiased.
* **Model interpretability**: The ability to understand and explain the decisions and actions of an AI or ML system.
* **Human oversight**: The involvement of human reviewers and evaluators in the development and deployment of AI and ML systems to detect and mitigate biases.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for bias audits involves the following steps:
1. **Data collection**: Gathering data on the AI or ML system's performance and outcomes.
2. **Data analysis**: Analyzing the data to identify potential biases and errors.
3. **Risk assessment**: Evaluating the potential risks and impacts of the identified biases and errors.
4. **Mitigation**: Taking corrective actions to reduce or eliminate the biases and errors.
5. **Monitoring**: Continuously monitoring the AI or ML system to detect and address any new biases or errors.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in bias audits include:
* **Regular auditing**: Conducting regular audits to detect and mitigate biases and errors.
* **Data validation**: Validating the accuracy and completeness of the data used to train and test AI and ML systems.
* **Model testing**: Testing AI and ML models to evaluate their performance and fairness.
* **Human review**: Involving human reviewers and evaluators in the development and deployment of AI and ML systems.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in bias audits include:
* **Ignoring biases**: Failing to acknowledge or address potential biases in AI and ML systems.
* **Lack of transparency**: Failing to provide clear and understandable explanations for the decisions and actions of AI and ML systems.
* **Inadequate testing**: Failing to thoroughly test AI and ML models to evaluate their performance and fairness.
* **Insufficient human oversight**: Failing to involve human reviewers and evaluators in the development and deployment of AI and ML systems.
