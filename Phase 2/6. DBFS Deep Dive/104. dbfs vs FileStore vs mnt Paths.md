# 104. dbfs vs FileStore vs mnt Paths

Canonical documentation for 104. dbfs vs FileStore vs mnt Paths. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 104. dbfs vs FileStore vs mnt Paths exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of understanding the differences between dbfs, FileStore, and mnt paths is to effectively manage and interact with file systems in various environments, particularly in cloud-based and distributed systems. This knowledge addresses the class of problems related to data storage, retrieval, and management in complex systems, ensuring efficient, secure, and reliable data handling.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
At a high level, dbfs, FileStore, and mnt paths represent different approaches to managing and accessing files in a system. dbfs (Databricks File System) is optimized for cloud-based data lakes and big data processing, FileStore is often associated with cloud storage services providing a hierarchical file system, and mnt paths refer to mount points in a file system where external storage devices or partitions are attached. Each has its use cases, advantages, and limitations, particularly in terms of performance, security, and scalability.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| dbfs | Databricks File System, a cloud-based file system optimized for big data processing and data lakes. |
| FileStore | A cloud storage service providing a hierarchical file system for storing and managing files. |
| mnt paths | Mount points in a file system where external storage devices or partitions are attached, allowing access to additional storage. |
| Data Lake | A centralized repository that stores all types of data in its native format. |
| Cloud Storage | A model of data storage where digital data is stored on remote servers accessed over the internet. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts include understanding the differences in architecture, performance, and use cases between dbfs, FileStore, and mnt paths. dbfs is designed for high-performance data processing and is closely integrated with Databricks and Spark, making it ideal for big data analytics. FileStore, on the other hand, offers a more traditional file system experience in the cloud, suitable for a wide range of applications. mnt paths are crucial for expanding local storage capacity and integrating external devices or network file systems into a local environment.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model involves using dbfs for big data and analytics workloads, FileStore for general-purpose cloud storage needs, and mnt paths for integrating external storage devices or network shares. This model emphasizes the importance of choosing the right tool for the specific task at hand, considering factors such as data size, processing requirements, and security needs.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns include using dbfs as the primary storage for data lakes and big data processing, leveraging FileStore for storing and serving static content or user files, and utilizing mnt paths for temporary or additional storage needs. Another pattern is the use of dbfs and FileStore in conjunction with mnt paths for creating a hybrid storage solution that balances performance, cost, and flexibility.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns include using dbfs for small, transactional data storage due to its optimization for large-scale, batch processing; relying solely on mnt paths for critical data storage, as they can be volatile and less secure; and using FileStore for high-performance computing workloads, where dbfs might be more appropriate. Another anti-pattern is neglecting to implement proper security and access controls across all storage solutions.
