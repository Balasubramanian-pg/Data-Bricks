# 107. Uploading Files Through CLI

Canonical documentation for 107. Uploading Files Through CLI. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 107. Uploading Files Through CLI exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of uploading files through the Command Line Interface (CLI) is to provide a programmatic way to transfer files from a local system to a remote server or cloud storage. This functionality addresses the need for automating file transfers, particularly in scenarios where graphical user interfaces are not available or feasible. The class of problems it addresses includes data migration, backup and recovery, and automated deployment of software applications.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Uploading files through CLI involves using commands and utilities that interact with the operating system and network protocols to establish a connection with the target server or storage. The process typically includes authentication, specifying the source and destination paths, and initiating the file transfer. This can be achieved using built-in operating system commands, third-party tools, or custom scripts.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| CLI | Command Line Interface, a text-based interface for interacting with an operating system or application. |
| FTP | File Transfer Protocol, a standard network protocol used for transferring files over the internet. |
| SFTP | Secure File Transfer Protocol, an extension of FTP that adds encryption for secure file transfers. |
| SCP | Secure Copy, a utility for securely copying files over a network. |
| API | Application Programming Interface, a set of defined rules that enable different applications to communicate with each other. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of uploading files through CLI include understanding the basics of command-line interfaces, familiarity with file transfer protocols (such as FTP, SFTP, and SCP), and knowledge of scripting languages for automation. Additionally, understanding network protocols, security considerations (like encryption and authentication), and error handling is crucial for reliable and secure file transfers.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for uploading files through CLI typically involves the following steps: 
1. Establishing a connection to the target server or storage using a specified protocol (e.g., FTP, SFTP, SCP).
2. Authenticating with the server using credentials or keys.
3. Specifying the source file(s) or directory on the local system.
4. Specifying the destination path on the remote server or storage.
5. Initiating the file transfer using a command or utility.
6. Monitoring the transfer process and handling any errors that may occur.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns include using scripts to automate repetitive file transfers, implementing batch processing for multiple files, and utilizing logging mechanisms for tracking and debugging purposes. Additionally, integrating file uploads with other automated tasks, such as data processing or deployment scripts, is a common practice.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns include using plain FTP for transferring sensitive data due to its lack of encryption, neglecting to validate the integrity of transferred files, and not implementing proper error handling and logging. Furthermore, hardcoding credentials into scripts and not regularly updating or patching file transfer utilities can lead to security vulnerabilities.
