> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 102. DBFS on Top of Cloud Object Storage exists and the class of problems it addresses.
DBFS on Top of Cloud Object Storage exists to provide a scalable, durable, and highly available file system solution for big data and analytics workloads. It addresses the class of problems related to storing, managing, and processing large amounts of unstructured and structured data in a cloud-native environment. The primary problems it solves include: 
- Providing a unified storage solution for diverse data types and sources
- Ensuring high performance and low latency for data access and processing
- Supporting scalable and elastic storage capacity to handle growing data volumes
- Offering robust security, governance, and compliance features for sensitive data

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
DBFS on Top of Cloud Object Storage is a cloud-based file system that leverages the scalability and durability of object storage to provide a flexible and performant storage solution. It abstracts the underlying object storage, presenting a hierarchical file system interface to users and applications. This allows for seamless integration with existing workflows, tools, and systems, while also enabling the benefits of cloud-native storage, such as on-demand scaling, high availability, and reduced administrative overhead.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| DBFS | A distributed file system designed to provide a scalable and performant storage solution for big data and analytics workloads |
| Cloud Object Storage | A type of cloud-based storage that stores data as objects, providing a scalable, durable, and highly available storage solution |
| Blob Storage | A type of object storage that stores unstructured data as blobs, providing a scalable and durable storage solution |
| File System Interface | A hierarchical interface that provides a standardized way of interacting with stored data, using concepts such as files, directories, and permissions |
| Metadata | Data that provides context and description for stored data, such as file names, sizes, and access control lists |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of DBFS on Top of Cloud Object Storage include:
- **Scalability**: The ability to scale storage capacity and performance on-demand to handle growing data volumes and changing workload requirements
- **Durability**: The ability to ensure that stored data is highly available and resistant to data loss, using techniques such as replication and erasure coding
- **Performance**: The ability to provide high-throughput and low-latency data access and processing, using techniques such as caching and parallel processing
- **Security**: The ability to provide robust security, governance, and compliance features, such as encryption, access control, and auditing

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for DBFS on Top of Cloud Object Storage involves the following components and interactions:
- **DBFS Layer**: A distributed file system that provides a hierarchical file system interface to users and applications
- **Object Storage Layer**: A cloud-based object storage solution that provides scalable and durable storage for stored data
- **Metadata Store**: A database that stores metadata for stored data, such as file names, sizes, and access control lists
- **Data Processing Layer**: A layer that provides data processing and analytics capabilities, using tools such as Apache Spark, Hadoop, and Presto

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for DBFS on Top of Cloud Object Storage include:
- **Data Ingestion**: Ingesting data from diverse sources, such as log files, social media, and IoT devices
- **Data Processing**: Processing ingested data using tools such as Apache Spark, Hadoop, and Presto
- **Data Storage**: Storing processed data in DBFS, using techniques such as partitioning and bucketing
- **Data Analytics**: Analyzing stored data using tools such as Apache Hive, Apache Impala, and Tableau

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for DBFS on Top of Cloud Object Storage include:
- **Using DBFS as a replacement for a relational database**: DBFS is designed for storing and processing large amounts of unstructured and semi-structured data, not for storing transactional data
- **Not using metadata effectively**: Metadata is essential for providing context and description for stored data, and should be used effectively to improve data discovery and governance
- **Not monitoring and optimizing performance**: DBFS on Top of Cloud Object Storage requires ongoing monitoring and optimization to ensure high performance and low latency
