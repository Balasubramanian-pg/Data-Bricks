# 108. Listing Directories with fs ls

Canonical documentation for 108. Listing Directories with fs ls. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 108. Listing Directories with fs ls exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The `fs ls` command is a fundamental tool in file system management, allowing users to list the contents of a directory. This functionality exists to address the need for users to visualize and navigate the hierarchy of files and directories on their system. The class of problems it addresses includes file management, directory navigation, and system administration.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The `fs ls` command operates on the file system, interacting with the directory structure to retrieve a list of files and subdirectories. This list is then presented to the user, typically in a human-readable format. The command can be used with various options to customize the output, such as sorting, filtering, and displaying detailed information about each file.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| File System | A system for organizing and storing files on a computer |
| Directory | A folder that contains files and subdirectories |
| `fs ls` | A command for listing the contents of a directory |
| File | A named collection of data stored on a computer |
| Subdirectory | A directory contained within another directory |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of `fs ls` include:
* Directory traversal: The ability to navigate through the directory structure
* File listing: The presentation of a list of files and subdirectories in a directory
* Option flags: Modifiers that can be used to customize the output of the `fs ls` command
* Error handling: The ability of the `fs ls` command to handle and report errors, such as permission denied or directory not found

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for using `fs ls` involves:
1. Specifying the directory to list, either by providing the full path or by navigating to the directory using the command line
2. Optionally, using flags to customize the output, such as `-l` for a detailed list or `-a` to include hidden files
3. Interpreting the output, which typically includes the file name, size, and modification date

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for using `fs ls` include:
* Using `fs ls` to verify the contents of a directory before performing an operation, such as deleting files
* Using `fs ls` with the `-l` flag to get detailed information about files, such as permissions and ownership
* Using `fs ls` with the `-R` flag to recursively list the contents of subdirectories

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for using `fs ls` include:
* Using `fs ls` without checking the current working directory, which can lead to unexpected results
* Using `fs ls` with excessive options, which can make the output difficult to read
* Relying solely on `fs ls` for file management, without using other tools, such as `fs mkdir` or `fs rm`
