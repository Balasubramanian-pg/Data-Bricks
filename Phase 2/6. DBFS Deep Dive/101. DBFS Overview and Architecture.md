# 101. DBFS Overview and Architecture

Canonical documentation for 101. DBFS Overview and Architecture. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 101. DBFS Overview and Architecture exists and the class of problems it addresses.
DBFS (Database File System) is a distributed file system that provides a scalable and fault-tolerant storage solution for large amounts of data. It addresses the need for a unified storage system that can handle the increasing demands of big data, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. The primary problem space that DBFS solves is the management of large amounts of unstructured and structured data in a scalable, secure, and efficient manner.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
DBFS is designed as a layered architecture, consisting of a client layer, a metadata layer, and a storage layer. The client layer provides an interface for applications to interact with the file system, while the metadata layer manages the organization and retrieval of data. The storage layer is responsible for the physical storage and retrieval of data. This layered architecture allows for scalability, flexibility, and high performance.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Block | A fixed-size unit of data storage |
| Chunk | A smaller unit of data storage within a block |
| Metadata | Data that describes the organization and structure of the file system |
| Node | A server or device that participates in the DBFS cluster |
| Replica | A copy of data stored on multiple nodes for redundancy and fault tolerance |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of DBFS include:
* Distributed storage: Data is split into smaller chunks and stored across multiple nodes in the cluster.
* Metadata management: The metadata layer maintains a catalog of data locations, ensuring efficient data retrieval.
* Replication: Data is replicated across multiple nodes to ensure redundancy and fault tolerance.
* Scalability: The system can scale horizontally by adding new nodes to the cluster.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for DBFS consists of a shared-nothing architecture, where each node in the cluster is responsible for a portion of the overall storage. This model allows for linear scalability and high performance. The metadata layer is typically implemented as a distributed database, ensuring that metadata is highly available and consistent across the cluster.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in DBFS include:
* Data striping: Data is split into smaller chunks and stored across multiple nodes.
* Data replication: Data is replicated across multiple nodes to ensure redundancy and fault tolerance.
* Load balancing: Client requests are distributed across multiple nodes to ensure efficient data retrieval.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in DBFS include:
* Single-point-of-failure architecture: A single node or component that can cause the entire system to fail.
* Insufficient replication: Data is not replicated sufficiently, leading to data loss in the event of node failure.
* Inconsistent metadata: Metadata is not properly synchronized across the cluster, leading to data inconsistencies.
