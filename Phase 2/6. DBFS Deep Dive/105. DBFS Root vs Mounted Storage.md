# 105. DBFS Root vs Mounted Storage

Canonical documentation for 105. DBFS Root vs Mounted Storage. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 105. DBFS Root vs Mounted Storage exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of understanding the difference between DBFS Root and Mounted Storage is to effectively manage and utilize storage resources in distributed file systems, particularly in cloud-based environments. This distinction addresses the class of problems related to data storage, access, and management in big data processing and analytics. It helps in optimizing storage usage, ensuring data security, and streamlining data access for various applications and services.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
DBFS (Databricks File System) Root and Mounted Storage are two concepts within the Databricks ecosystem that pertain to how data is stored and accessed. DBFS Root refers to the root directory of the Databricks File System, which is a cloud-based storage system designed for big data processing. Mounted Storage, on the other hand, involves mounting external storage systems, such as AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, or Google Cloud Storage, to the DBFS, allowing for seamless integration and access to data stored in these external systems.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| DBFS | Databricks File System, a cloud-based storage system for big data. |
| DBFS Root | The root directory of the Databricks File System. |
| Mounted Storage | External storage systems mounted to the DBFS for integrated access. |
| Mount Point | The directory in DBFS where an external storage system is mounted. |
| Cloud Storage | External storage services like AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, or Google Cloud Storage. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts include understanding the hierarchy and structure of DBFS, recognizing how mounted storage integrates with DBFS, and knowing how to manage access and permissions to both DBFS Root and mounted storage. Additionally, understanding the performance, security, and scalability implications of using DBFS Root versus mounted storage is crucial for optimizing data storage and processing workflows.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model involves using DBFS Root for storing data that is frequently accessed or modified within the Databricks environment, such as intermediate processing results or metadata. For larger datasets or data that needs to be shared across multiple platforms, mounted storage is recommended, as it allows for cost-effective storage and scalability. The mount point in DBFS should be carefully chosen to reflect the organizational structure of the data for easy access and management.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns include mounting external storage to DBFS for data ingestion, using DBFS Root for temporary or intermediate data, and implementing access control and encryption for both DBFS Root and mounted storage to ensure data security. Another pattern is to use DBFS for data that requires high-performance access, while using mounted storage for archival or less frequently accessed data.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns include storing large amounts of data in DBFS Root without considering scalability and cost implications, failing to implement proper access controls and encryption, and not regularly cleaning up unused or temporary data in DBFS Root. Another discouraged practice is mounting storage without considering the performance impact of accessing data across different storage systems.
