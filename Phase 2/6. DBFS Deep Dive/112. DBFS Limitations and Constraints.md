# 112. DBFS Limitations and Constraints

Canonical documentation for 112. DBFS Limitations and Constraints. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 112. DBFS Limitations and Constraints exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The DBFS (Database File System) Limitations and Constraints documentation exists to provide a comprehensive understanding of the restrictions and boundaries that govern the use of DBFS in various database management systems. The class of problems it addresses includes data storage, file system management, and database performance optimization. DBFS is designed to provide a file system interface to database storage, allowing files to be stored and managed within the database. However, DBFS has limitations and constraints that can impact its performance, scalability, and usability. This documentation aims to provide a clear understanding of these limitations and constraints, enabling database administrators and developers to design and implement efficient DBFS solutions.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The DBFS Limitations and Constraints conceptual model consists of three primary components: 
1. **Storage Limitations**: restrictions on the amount of data that can be stored in DBFS, including file size limits, total storage capacity, and storage allocation mechanisms.
2. **Performance Constraints**: limitations on the speed and efficiency of DBFS operations, including file access times, data transfer rates, and query performance.
3. **Security and Access Control**: restrictions on user access to DBFS, including authentication, authorization, and encryption mechanisms.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| DBFS | Database File System, a file system interface to database storage |
| Storage Quota | the maximum amount of storage space allocated to a user or database |
| File Size Limit | the maximum size of a file that can be stored in DBFS |
| Performance Threshold | the maximum allowable latency or throughput for DBFS operations |
| Access Control List (ACL) | a list of users or groups with permission to access DBFS resources |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of DBFS Limitations and Constraints include:
* **Storage Management**: the process of allocating, deallocating, and managing storage space in DBFS.
* **Performance Optimization**: the process of tuning DBFS configuration parameters to achieve optimal performance.
* **Security and Compliance**: the process of ensuring that DBFS meets regulatory and organizational security requirements.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for DBFS Limitations and Constraints consists of a hierarchical structure with the following components:
1. **DBFS Instance**: the top-level entity that represents a DBFS deployment.
2. **Storage Pools**: logical containers that manage storage allocation and deallocation.
3. **File Systems**: logical containers that manage file storage and access.
4. **Files**: individual files stored in DBFS.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for DBFS Limitations and Constraints include:
* **Storage Tiering**: allocating storage to different tiers based on performance and cost requirements.
* **Caching**: using cache mechanisms to improve DBFS performance.
* **Load Balancing**: distributing workload across multiple DBFS instances to improve scalability.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for DBFS Limitations and Constraints include:
* **Over-Allocating Storage**: allocating excessive storage space, leading to waste and inefficiency.
* **Under-Configuring Performance**: failing to optimize DBFS configuration parameters, leading to suboptimal performance.
* **Ignoring Security**: neglecting to implement proper security and access control mechanisms, leading to security vulnerabilities.
