Canonical documentation for 114. Schema Files and Intermediate Outputs. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 114. Schema Files and Intermediate Outputs exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of 114. Schema Files and Intermediate Outputs is to provide a standardized approach to managing and transforming data between different systems, applications, or formats. This topic addresses the class of problems related to data integration, exchange, and processing, where schema files and intermediate outputs play a crucial role in ensuring data consistency, accuracy, and compatibility.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual model of 114. Schema Files and Intermediate Outputs revolves around the idea of using schema files to define the structure and organization of data, and intermediate outputs to represent the transformed data in a temporary or transitional state. This model involves a series of steps, including data ingestion, schema validation, data transformation, and output generation, which ultimately enable the creation of standardized, high-quality data products.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Schema File | A file that defines the structure, organization, and relationships of data, typically using a standardized format such as XML or JSON. |
| Intermediate Output | A temporary or transitional representation of data, often used as input for further processing, transformation, or analysis. |
| Data Transformation | The process of converting data from one format, structure, or representation to another, often using schema files and intermediate outputs. |
| Data Validation | The process of verifying the accuracy, completeness, and consistency of data against a schema file or other reference. |
| Data Ingestion | The process of acquiring, importing, or loading data from various sources, often using schema files and intermediate outputs. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of 114. Schema Files and Intermediate Outputs include:
* Data standardization: The use of schema files to define a common structure and format for data, ensuring consistency and compatibility across different systems and applications.
* Data transformation: The process of converting data from one format to another, using schema files and intermediate outputs to enable data exchange, integration, and processing.
* Data validation: The process of verifying the accuracy, completeness, and consistency of data against a schema file or other reference, ensuring data quality and reliability.
* Data ingestion: The process of acquiring, importing, or loading data from various sources, often using schema files and intermediate outputs to enable data integration and processing.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for 114. Schema Files and Intermediate Outputs involves the following steps:
1. Data ingestion: Acquire, import, or load data from various sources.
2. Schema validation: Verify the accuracy, completeness, and consistency of data against a schema file.
3. Data transformation: Convert data from one format to another, using schema files and intermediate outputs.
4. Intermediate output generation: Create a temporary or transitional representation of data, often used as input for further processing, transformation, or analysis.
5. Output generation: Create a final, standardized output, often using the intermediate output as input.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in 114. Schema Files and Intermediate Outputs include:
* Using schema files to define a common structure and format for data, ensuring consistency and compatibility across different systems and applications.
* Using intermediate outputs to represent transformed data in a temporary or transitional state, enabling further processing, transformation, or analysis.
* Implementing data validation and data transformation steps to ensure data quality and reliability.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in 114. Schema Files and Intermediate Outputs include:
* Using proprietary or custom schema files, which can lead to data incompatibility and integration issues.
* Failing to implement data validation and data transformation steps, which can result in poor data quality and reliability.
* Using intermediate outputs as final outputs, which can lead to data inconsistencies and compatibility issues.
