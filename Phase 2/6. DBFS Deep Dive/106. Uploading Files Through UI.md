Canonical documentation for 106. Uploading Files Through UI. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 106. Uploading Files Through UI exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of uploading files through a User Interface (UI) is to enable users to transfer files from their local systems to a remote server or application, facilitating various use cases such as data import, file sharing, and document management. The problem space addressed by this functionality includes the need for a secure, reliable, and user-friendly mechanism for transferring files, while also ensuring compatibility with different file formats, sizes, and types.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of uploading files through a UI involves a client-server architecture, where the client (typically a web browser or desktop application) initiates a file upload request to the server. The server then processes the request, validates the file, and stores it in a designated repository. The UI provides a interface for users to select files, monitor upload progress, and receive feedback on the upload status.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| File Upload | The process of transferring a file from a local system to a remote server or application. |
| UI Component | A graphical element, such as a button or input field, used to interact with the file upload functionality. |
| Upload Request | An HTTP request sent from the client to the server to initiate a file upload. |
| File Validation | The process of checking the uploaded file for correctness, integrity, and compliance with predefined rules. |
| Repository | A storage system used to manage and retain uploaded files. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of uploading files through a UI include:
* **File selection**: allowing users to choose one or multiple files for upload.
* **Upload protocol**: defining the communication protocol used for transferring files, such as HTTP or FTP.
* **File processing**: handling file validation, storage, and retrieval on the server-side.
* **Error handling**: providing feedback and recovery mechanisms for upload failures or errors.
* **Security**: ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of uploaded files.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for uploading files through a UI involves the following steps:
1. User selects a file for upload using a UI component.
2. The client sends an upload request to the server.
3. The server validates the file and checks for any errors.
4. If valid, the server stores the file in a repository.
5. The server returns a response to the client, indicating the upload status.
6. The UI updates the user interface to reflect the upload result.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for uploading files through a UI include:
* **Drag-and-drop**: allowing users to drag files from their local system and drop them into a designated upload area.
* **File input fields**: using HTML input fields to enable file selection and upload.
* **Upload buttons**: providing a dedicated button to initiate the upload process.
* **Progress indicators**: displaying a progress bar or other visual cue to show the upload progress.
* **Error messages**: displaying informative error messages to help users recover from upload failures.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for uploading files through a UI include:
* **Insecure file handling**: failing to validate or sanitize uploaded files, exposing the application to security risks.
* **Poor error handling**: not providing informative error messages or feedback, leaving users frustrated and unsure of how to proceed.
* **Inconsistent UI**: using inconsistent or confusing UI elements, making it difficult for users to understand the upload process.
* **Lack of feedback**: not providing any feedback or progress indicators, leaving users uncertain about the upload status.
* **Insufficient testing**: not thoroughly testing the upload functionality, leading to unexpected errors or issues.
