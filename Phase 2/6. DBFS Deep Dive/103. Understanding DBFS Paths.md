Canonical documentation for 103. Understanding DBFS Paths. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 103. Understanding DBFS Paths exists and the class of problems it addresses.
DBFS (Databricks File System) paths are a crucial component in managing and accessing data within the Databricks ecosystem. Understanding DBFS paths is essential for data engineers, data scientists, and analysts to efficiently store, process, and retrieve data. The primary problem space that DBFS paths address is the need for a unified, scalable, and secure file system that can handle large volumes of data and support various data processing workloads.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
DBFS paths can be thought of as a hierarchical file system that allows users to organize and manage their data in a structured manner. The DBFS path is a string that represents the location of a file or directory within the DBFS hierarchy. It consists of a series of components separated by forward slashes (/), similar to a Unix-like file system. The DBFS path provides a unique identifier for each file or directory, enabling efficient data access and management.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| DBFS | Databricks File System, a cloud-based file system designed for big data storage and processing |
| DBFS Path | A string representing the location of a file or directory within the DBFS hierarchy |
| Mount Point | A directory in DBFS where external storage systems, such as S3 or Azure Blob Storage, are mounted |
| File System | A hierarchical system for organizing and storing files and directories |
| Directory | A container for files and subdirectories within the DBFS hierarchy |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of DBFS paths include:
* **Hierarchy**: DBFS paths are organized in a hierarchical structure, with each component representing a directory or file.
* **Uniqueness**: Each DBFS path is unique, ensuring that files and directories can be efficiently located and accessed.
* **Mount points**: External storage systems can be mounted to DBFS, allowing for seamless integration with other data sources.
* **Security**: DBFS paths are subject to access control and authentication mechanisms, ensuring that data is protected and secure.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for DBFS paths follows a Unix-like convention, with the following components:
* **Root directory** (/): The top-level directory in the DBFS hierarchy.
* **Mount points** (/mnt): Directories where external storage systems are mounted.
* **User directories** (/user): Directories assigned to individual users for storing personal files and data.
* **Shared directories** (/shared): Directories accessible by multiple users for collaborative work.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for using DBFS paths include:
* **Data ingestion**: Using DBFS paths to load data from external sources into Databricks for processing and analysis.
* **Data storage**: Using DBFS paths to store processed data, such as data lakes or data warehouses.
* **Collaboration**: Using shared directories and DBFS paths to facilitate collaboration among team members.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for using DBFS paths include:
* **Hardcoding paths**: Using hardcoded DBFS paths in code, which can lead to inflexibility and maintenance issues.
* **Unsecured data**: Failing to implement proper access control and authentication mechanisms for DBFS paths, compromising data security.
* **Unorganized hierarchy**: Neglecting to maintain a structured and organized DBFS hierarchy, leading to data management challenges.
