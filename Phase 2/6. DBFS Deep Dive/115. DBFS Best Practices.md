# 115. DBFS Best Practices

Canonical documentation for 115. DBFS Best Practices. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 115. DBFS Best Practices exists and the class of problems it addresses.
DBFS (Databricks File System) Best Practices exist to provide a standardized approach to managing and optimizing data storage and processing in Databricks environments. The primary problem space addressed by DBFS Best Practices includes data management, performance optimization, security, and scalability. By following these best practices, users can ensure efficient, reliable, and secure data processing and storage in their Databricks workloads.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of DBFS Best Practices involves understanding the key components and interactions within a Databricks environment. This includes DBFS itself, which is a distributed file system designed for high-performance and scalability, as well as other Databricks components such as clusters, jobs, and notebooks. The mental model should encompass how data is ingested, processed, and stored within DBFS, and how best practices can be applied to optimize these processes.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| DBFS | Databricks File System, a distributed file system for storing and managing data in Databricks environments. |
| Cluster | A set of nodes in a Databricks environment that provide compute resources for data processing. |
| Job | A self-contained piece of code that is executed on a Databricks cluster to perform a specific task. |
| Notebook | An interactive web-based interface for working with data in Databricks, supporting code execution, visualization, and collaboration. |
| Mount Point | A directory in DBFS where external storage systems can be mounted, allowing for seamless integration with other data sources. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of DBFS Best Practices include data organization, access control, performance optimization, and data lifecycle management. Data organization involves structuring data in a logical and consistent manner to facilitate efficient access and processing. Access control is critical for ensuring that data is only accessible to authorized users and services, enhancing security and compliance. Performance optimization involves configuring DBFS and Databricks resources to achieve the best possible processing speeds and throughput. Data lifecycle management encompasses the strategies and practices for managing data from creation to archival or deletion, ensuring that data is handled appropriately throughout its entire lifecycle.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for DBFS Best Practices involves a tiered storage approach, where frequently accessed data is stored in high-performance storage tiers (such as DBFS), and less frequently accessed data is stored in lower-cost, archival storage tiers. This model also recommends implementing robust access controls, including role-based access control (RBAC) and encryption, to protect data from unauthorized access. Regular data backups and disaster recovery planning are also integral components of the standard model, ensuring business continuity in the event of data loss or system failure.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in DBFS Best Practices include using DBFS for transient data and external storage systems for long-term data retention, implementing data validation and cleansing workflows to ensure data quality, and leveraging Databricks jobs and notebooks for data processing and analysis. Another pattern is the use of mount points to integrate DBFS with external data sources, such as cloud storage or on-premises file systems, facilitating data exchange and collaboration across different systems and environments.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in DBFS Best Practices include storing sensitive data in plain text within DBFS, failing to implement adequate access controls or encryption, and not regularly backing up critical data. Other discouraged practices include over-reliance on a single storage tier without considering data lifecycle and cost implications, and neglecting to monitor and optimize DBFS and Databricks cluster performance, leading to inefficiencies and potential data processing bottlenecks.
