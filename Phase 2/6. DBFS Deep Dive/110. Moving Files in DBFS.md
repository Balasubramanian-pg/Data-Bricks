Canonical documentation for 110. Moving Files in DBFS. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 110. Moving Files in DBFS exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of moving files in DBFS (Databricks File System) is to efficiently manage and organize data within the system. DBFS is a cloud-based file system designed for big data and analytics workloads, providing a scalable and secure repository for storing and retrieving data. The class of problems it addresses includes data organization, data migration, and data management, ensuring that data is properly structured, easily accessible, and optimized for performance.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Moving files in DBFS involves transferring data from one location to another within the DBFS hierarchy. This process can be initiated through various methods, including the Databricks UI, DBFS command-line interface (CLI), or programmatically using APIs. The conceptual model encompasses understanding the DBFS directory structure, file permissions, and the implications of moving files on data integrity, security, and system performance.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| DBFS | Databricks File System, a cloud-based file system for storing and managing data. |
| Mount Point | A directory in DBFS where external storage systems are mounted, allowing access to data from these systems. |
| File System | A method for storing, retrieving, and managing data on a computer. |
| Directory | A folder or location within a file system where files are stored. |
| Path | The sequence of directories leading to a specific file or directory. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of moving files in DBFS include understanding the file system hierarchy, recognizing the importance of file permissions and access control, and being aware of the tools and methods available for moving files, such as the DBFS CLI, Databricks notebooks, and external tools integrated with DBFS.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for moving files in DBFS involves using the DBFS CLI or the Databricks UI for most operations. This approach ensures that file movements are properly logged, secured, and optimized for performance. For automated or large-scale file movements, using Databricks notebooks or integrating with external tools and scripts is recommended.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns include regularly organizing and cleaning up data directories, using versioning to track changes to files, and implementing automated scripts for routine file movements. Additionally, using mount points to integrate external storage systems and leveraging Databricks jobs for scheduled file operations are accepted practices.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns include manually moving large volumes of data without proper logging or version control, ignoring file permissions and access controls, and using unsupported or deprecated methods for file manipulation. These practices can lead to data corruption, security breaches, and system instability.
