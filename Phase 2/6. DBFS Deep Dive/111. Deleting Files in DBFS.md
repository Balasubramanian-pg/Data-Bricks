Canonical documentation for 111. Deleting Files in DBFS. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 111. Deleting Files in DBFS exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of deleting files in DBFS (Databricks File System) is to manage storage space, remove unnecessary data, and maintain data consistency. DBFS is a cloud-based file system designed for use with Databricks, a platform for data engineering, data science, and data analytics. The problem space addressed by deleting files in DBFS includes removing temporary files, deleting outdated data, and freeing up storage space to optimize system performance.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Deleting files in DBFS involves removing files and directories from the file system, which can be done using various methods such as the Databricks UI, DBFS command-line interface, or through programming languages like Python or Scala. The conceptual overview of deleting files in DBFS includes understanding the file system hierarchy, file permissions, and the implications of deleting files on dependent jobs, notebooks, and data pipelines.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| DBFS | Databricks File System, a cloud-based file system for storing and managing data |
| File | A named collection of data stored in DBFS |
| Directory | A folder that contains files and subdirectories in DBFS |
| Delete | To permanently remove a file or directory from DBFS |
| Trash | A temporary storage area for deleted files, allowing for recovery in case of accidental deletion |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of deleting files in DBFS include:
* **File system hierarchy**: Understanding the organization of files and directories in DBFS
* **File permissions**: Managing access control and ownership of files and directories
* **Delete operations**: Using various methods to delete files and directories, such as the Databricks UI, DBFS command-line interface, or programming languages
* **Data recovery**: Understanding the options for recovering deleted files, including the use of trash and versioning

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for deleting files in DBFS involves:
1. **Identifying files to delete**: Selecting the files and directories to be removed
2. **Checking dependencies**: Verifying that the files to be deleted are not used by dependent jobs, notebooks, or data pipelines
3. **Deleting files**: Using the chosen method to delete the files and directories
4. **Verifying deletion**: Confirming that the files have been successfully deleted

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for deleting files in DBFS include:
* **Scheduled deletion**: Scheduling regular deletion of temporary files or outdated data
* **Automated deletion**: Using scripts or programs to automate the deletion of files based on specific conditions
* **Manual deletion**: Manually deleting files and directories using the Databricks UI or DBFS command-line interface

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for deleting files in DBFS include:
* **Mass deletion**: Deleting large numbers of files without verifying dependencies or checking for errors
* **Uncontrolled deletion**: Allowing unauthorized users to delete files or directories
* **Inconsistent deletion**: Failing to consistently apply deletion policies or procedures
