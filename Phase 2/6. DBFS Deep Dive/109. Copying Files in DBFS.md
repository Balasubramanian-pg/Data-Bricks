# 109. Copying Files in DBFS

Canonical documentation for 109. Copying Files in DBFS. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 109. Copying Files in DBFS exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of copying files in DBFS (Databricks File System) is to enable the duplication of files within the system, allowing for data backup, replication, and synchronization. This functionality addresses the problem of data management and consistency in distributed file systems, ensuring that files are accurately copied and preserved across different locations.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Copying files in DBFS involves creating an exact replica of a file, including its contents and metadata, at a specified destination within the file system. This process can be initiated through various interfaces, such as the Databricks UI, DBFS command-line interface, or programmatically using APIs. The conceptual model encompasses the source file, destination location, and the copying process itself, which may involve data transfer, validation, and error handling.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Source File | The original file to be copied, including its contents and metadata. |
| Destination | The target location where the copied file will be stored. |
| DBFS | Databricks File System, a distributed file system designed for big data storage and processing. |
| File Metadata | Information associated with a file, such as its name, size, and permissions. |
| Data Transfer | The process of moving data from the source file to the destination location. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of copying files in DBFS include:
* **Data Integrity**: Ensuring that the copied file is an exact replica of the source file, with no data corruption or loss.
* **File System Consistency**: Maintaining the consistency of the file system, including metadata and permissions, during the copying process.
* **Scalability**: Supporting the copying of large files and datasets, with efficient data transfer and minimal performance impact.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for copying files in DBFS involves the following steps:
1. **Source File Selection**: Identifying the source file to be copied.
2. **Destination Specification**: Specifying the destination location for the copied file.
3. **Copy Initiation**: Initiating the copying process, which may involve data transfer, validation, and error handling.
4. **Copy Verification**: Verifying the integrity and consistency of the copied file.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for copying files in DBFS include:
* **Backup and Recovery**: Copying files for backup and disaster recovery purposes.
* **Data Replication**: Copying files for data replication and synchronization across different locations.
* **Data Migration**: Copying files as part of a data migration process, such as moving data from one storage system to another.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for copying files in DBFS include:
* **Inconsistent File Naming**: Using inconsistent file naming conventions, which can lead to confusion and errors.
* **Insufficient Error Handling**: Failing to implement adequate error handling and logging mechanisms, which can result in data loss or corruption.
* **Unnecessary Data Duplication**: Copying files unnecessarily, which can lead to storage waste and performance issues.
