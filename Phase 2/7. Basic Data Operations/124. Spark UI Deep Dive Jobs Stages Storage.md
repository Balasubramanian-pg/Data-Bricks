# 124. Spark UI Deep Dive Jobs Stages Storage

Canonical documentation for 124. Spark UI Deep Dive Jobs Stages Storage. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 124. Spark UI Deep Dive Jobs Stages Storage exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The Spark UI is a web-based interface that provides detailed information about the execution of Spark jobs, including job stages, tasks, and storage usage. The purpose of the Spark UI is to provide a centralized location for monitoring, debugging, and optimizing Spark applications. The class of problems it addresses includes understanding job execution, identifying performance bottlenecks, and optimizing resource utilization.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The Spark UI provides a hierarchical view of job execution, with the following components: jobs, stages, tasks, and storage. Jobs are the top-level entities, which are divided into stages. Stages are further divided into tasks, which are the basic units of execution. Storage refers to the memory and disk usage of the Spark application.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Job | A top-level entity that represents a Spark application |
| Stage | A subset of tasks that are executed together |
| Task | A basic unit of execution that performs a specific operation |
| Storage | The memory and disk usage of the Spark application |
| RDD | Resilient Distributed Dataset, a fundamental data structure in Spark |
| DataFrame | A distributed collection of data organized into named columns |
| Dataset | A distributed collection of data that is strongly-typed |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of the Spark UI include: (1) job execution, which involves the submission, execution, and completion of Spark jobs; (2) stage execution, which involves the execution of tasks within a stage; (3) task execution, which involves the execution of a specific operation; and (4) storage management, which involves the allocation and deallocation of memory and disk resources.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for the Spark UI involves the following components: (1) job dashboard, which provides a high-level overview of job execution; (2) stage details, which provide detailed information about stage execution; (3) task details, which provide detailed information about task execution; and (4) storage details, which provide detailed information about storage usage.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in the Spark UI include: (1) monitoring job execution, which involves tracking the progress of jobs and identifying performance bottlenecks; (2) debugging job execution, which involves identifying and resolving issues that occur during job execution; and (3) optimizing resource utilization, which involves adjusting the configuration of Spark applications to optimize resource usage.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in the Spark UI include: (1) over-reliance on the Spark UI, which can lead to neglect of other monitoring and debugging tools; (2) inadequate configuration, which can lead to poor performance and resource utilization; and (3) lack of monitoring, which can lead to undetected issues and performance bottlenecks.
