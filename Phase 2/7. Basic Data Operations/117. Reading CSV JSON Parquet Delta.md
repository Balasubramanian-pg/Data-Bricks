> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 117. Reading CSV JSON Parquet Delta exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of reading CSV, JSON, Parquet, and Delta files is to provide a standardized method for accessing and processing data stored in these formats. The problem space addressed by this topic includes the need for efficient, scalable, and reliable data ingestion from various file formats, which is a crucial aspect of data engineering, data science, and business intelligence. The ability to read these file formats is essential for data processing, analysis, and visualization, enabling organizations to extract insights and make informed decisions.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of reading CSV, JSON, Parquet, and Delta files involves understanding the characteristics of each file format, including their structure, advantages, and use cases. CSV (Comma Separated Values) files are plain text files used for tabular data, JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) files are used for semi-structured data, Parquet files are columnar storage files optimized for big data processing, and Delta files are an open-format storage layer that provides ACID transactions and metadata management. The process of reading these files typically involves using libraries, frameworks, or tools that provide APIs for data ingestion, parsing, and processing.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| CSV | Comma Separated Values file format, used for tabular data |
| JSON | JavaScript Object Notation file format, used for semi-structured data |
| Parquet | Columnar storage file format, optimized for big data processing |
| Delta | Open-format storage layer, providing ACID transactions and metadata management |
| Data Ingestion | The process of collecting, transporting, and processing data from various sources |
| Data Processing | The process of transforming, aggregating, and analyzing data to extract insights |

## 4. Core Concepts
