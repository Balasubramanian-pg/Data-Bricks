Canonical documentation for 122. Understanding Data Partitions. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 122. Understanding Data Partitions exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of understanding data partitions is to effectively manage and organize large datasets, ensuring efficient data retrieval, storage, and analysis. The problem space addressed by data partitions includes data scalability, query performance, and data distribution. By dividing data into smaller, more manageable partitions, organizations can improve data accessibility, reduce storage costs, and enhance overall system performance.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Data partitioning is a technique used to divide a large dataset into smaller, independent segments called partitions. Each partition contains a subset of the overall data and is typically defined by a specific criteria, such as date range, geographic location, or user ID. By partitioning data, organizations can distribute it across multiple storage devices, nodes, or servers, improving data availability, scalability, and query performance.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Data Partition | A subset of a larger dataset, defined by specific criteria, and stored independently. |
| Partition Key | A column or set of columns used to determine the partitioning criteria. |
| Partition Scheme | A predefined set of rules that defines how data is partitioned and stored. |
| Horizontal Partitioning | A technique that divides data into partitions based on rows, using a partition key. |
| Vertical Partitioning | A technique that divides data into partitions based on columns, using a partition key. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of data partitioning include:
* **Data distribution**: The process of dividing data into smaller partitions and distributing them across multiple storage devices or nodes.
* **Partitioning criteria**: The rules or conditions used to determine how data is partitioned, such as date range or user ID.
* **Partition management**: The process of creating, managing, and maintaining data partitions, including tasks such as data loading, indexing, and querying.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for data partitioning typically involves the following steps:
1. **Define partitioning criteria**: Determine the criteria used to partition the data, such as date range or user ID.
2. **Create partition scheme**: Define the partition scheme, including the number of partitions, partition size, and partition key.
3. **Partition data**: Divide the data into partitions based on the partitioning criteria and scheme.
4. **Store partitions**: Store each partition independently, using a storage device or node.
5. **Manage partitions**: Perform ongoing management tasks, such as data loading, indexing, and querying.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in data partitioning include:
* **Time-based partitioning**: Partitioning data by date range, such as daily, weekly, or monthly.
* **User-based partitioning**: Partitioning data by user ID or user group.
* **Geographic partitioning**: Partitioning data by geographic location, such as country or region.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in data partitioning include:
* **Over-partitioning**: Creating too many partitions, leading to increased complexity and decreased performance.
* **Under-partitioning**: Creating too few partitions, leading to decreased scalability and increased storage costs.
* **Inconsistent partitioning**: Using inconsistent partitioning criteria or schemes, leading to data inconsistencies and query performance issues.
