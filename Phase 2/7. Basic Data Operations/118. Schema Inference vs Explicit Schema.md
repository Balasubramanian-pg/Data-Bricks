> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 118. Schema Inference vs Explicit Schema exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of 118. Schema Inference vs Explicit Schema is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the trade-offs between schema inference and explicit schema definition in data management systems. The problem space addressed by this topic includes data integration, data quality, and data governance, where the choice between schema inference and explicit schema definition can significantly impact the accuracy, efficiency, and scalability of data processing and analysis.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Schema inference and explicit schema definition are two approaches to defining the structure of data in a database or data warehouse. Schema inference involves automatically generating a schema based on the data itself, while explicit schema definition requires manual definition of the schema by a developer or data architect. The choice between these two approaches depends on factors such as data complexity, data quality, and the need for data governance and compliance.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Schema | A blueprint or layout that defines the structure of data, including the relationships between different data elements |
| Schema Inference | The process of automatically generating a schema based on the data itself, using algorithms and statistical methods |
| Explicit Schema Definition | The manual definition of a schema by a developer or data architect, using a data definition language (DDL) or other schema definition tools |
| Data Governance | The process of managing the availability, usability, integrity, and security of data across an organization |
| Data Quality | The degree to which data is accurate, complete, consistent, and reliable |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of 118. Schema Inference vs Explicit Schema include:
* **Schema flexibility**: The ability of a schema to adapt to changing data structures and relationships
* **Schema complexity**: The degree to which a schema is simple or complex, affecting its maintainability and scalability
* **Data discovery**: The process of identifying and understanding the structure and content of data
* **Data lineage**: The record of data origins, processing, and transformations, affecting data quality and governance

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for 118. Schema Inference vs Explicit Schema involves a hybrid approach that combines the benefits of both schema inference and explicit schema definition. This model includes:
* **Initial schema inference**: Automatically generating a schema based on the data itself
* **Schema refinement**: Manually refining and updating the schema based on data quality, governance, and compliance requirements
* **Ongoing schema evolution**: Continuously monitoring and updating the schema as data structures and relationships change

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in 118. Schema Inference vs Explicit Schema include:
* **Data lake architecture**: Using schema inference to generate a schema for raw, unprocessed data in a data lake
* **Data warehouse architecture**: Using explicit schema definition to define a schema for processed, transformed data in a data warehouse
* **Data governance framework**: Establishing a framework for data governance and compliance, including data quality, security, and access controls

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in 118. Schema Inference vs Explicit Schema include:
* **Over-reliance on schema inference**: Failing to manually refine and update a schema, leading to data quality and governance issues
* **Inflexible schema definition**: Failing to adapt a schema to changing data structures and relationships, leading to data integration and processing issues
* **Lack of data governance**: Failing to establish a framework for data governance and compliance, leading to data security and access control issues
