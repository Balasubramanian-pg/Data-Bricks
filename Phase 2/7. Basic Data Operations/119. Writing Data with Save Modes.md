> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 119. Writing Data with Save Modes exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of 119. Writing Data with Save Modes is to provide a standardized approach to writing data to storage systems while ensuring data consistency and integrity. This topic addresses the class of problems related to data loss, corruption, and inconsistencies that can occur when writing data to storage systems. The problem space includes scenarios where data is written to storage systems in a way that is not recoverable, or where data is corrupted during the write process, resulting in data loss or inconsistencies.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of 119. Writing Data with Save Modes involves understanding the different save modes available for writing data to storage systems. These save modes include append-only, overwrite, and update-in-place, each with its own trade-offs and use cases. The conceptual model also involves understanding the importance of data consistency and integrity when writing data to storage systems, as well as the need to balance performance and reliability.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Save Mode | A configuration setting that determines how data is written to a storage system, such as append-only, overwrite, or update-in-place. |
| Data Consistency | The state of data being consistent across all storage systems and replicas, ensuring that data is accurate and reliable. |
| Data Integrity | The state of data being free from corruption or errors, ensuring that data is trustworthy and reliable. |
| Append-Only | A save mode where data is written to the end of a file or storage system, without modifying existing data. |
| Overwrite | A save mode where data is written to a file or storage system, replacing existing data. |
| Update-In-Place | A save mode where data is written to a file or storage system, updating existing data in place. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of 119. Writing Data with Save Modes include understanding the different save modes available, the importance of data consistency and integrity, and the need to balance performance and reliability. Additionally, core concepts include understanding the trade-offs between different save modes, such as the trade-off between append-only and overwrite, and the importance of selecting the correct save mode for a given use case.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for 119. Writing Data with Save Modes involves using a combination of save modes to ensure data consistency and integrity. The recommended model includes using append-only for logging and auditing, overwrite for bulk data imports, and update-in-place for real-time data updates. Additionally, the standard model includes implementing data validation and error handling mechanisms to ensure data consistency and integrity.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for 119. Writing Data with Save Modes include using append-only for logging and auditing, using overwrite for bulk data imports, and using update-in-place for real-time data updates. Additionally, common patterns include implementing data validation and error handling mechanisms, using transactions to ensure data consistency, and using replication to ensure data availability.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for 119. Writing Data with Save Modes include using overwrite for real-time data updates, using update-in-place for bulk data imports, and not implementing data validation and error handling mechanisms. Additionally, anti-patterns include not using transactions to ensure data consistency, not using replication to ensure data availability, and not selecting the correct save mode for a given use case.
