Canonical documentation for 125. Phase 2 Review and Practical Assessment. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 125. Phase 2 Review and Practical Assessment exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The 125. Phase 2 Review and Practical Assessment is a critical component of a comprehensive evaluation process, designed to assess the proficiency and readiness of individuals or systems in a specific domain. It exists to address the need for a rigorous, standardized evaluation methodology that can identify areas of strength and weakness, providing a basis for informed decision-making and targeted improvement.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The 125. Phase 2 Review and Practical Assessment can be conceptualized as a multi-stage evaluation process, comprising a review of theoretical knowledge and a practical assessment of applied skills. This process is designed to simulate real-world scenarios, allowing assessors to evaluate the ability of individuals or systems to perform tasks, make decisions, and demonstrate competence in a practical context.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Phase 2 Review | A comprehensive evaluation of theoretical knowledge and understanding, typically conducted through written or oral examinations. |
| Practical Assessment | A hands-on evaluation of applied skills and competence, typically conducted through simulations, case studies, or real-world exercises. |
| Proficiency | The demonstrated ability to perform tasks, make decisions, and apply knowledge in a specific domain. |
| Readiness | The state of being prepared to perform tasks, make decisions, and apply knowledge in a specific domain, as determined by the results of the Phase 2 Review and Practical Assessment. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts underlying the 125. Phase 2 Review and Practical Assessment include:
* **Validity**: The extent to which the evaluation process measures what it is intended to measure.
* **Reliability**: The consistency and dependability of the evaluation results.
* **Generalizability**: The extent to which the evaluation results can be applied to real-world scenarios.
* **Equity**: The fairness and impartiality of the evaluation process.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for the 125. Phase 2 Review and Practical Assessment typically involves the following stages:
1. **Pre-Assessment**: Preparation and orientation of assessors and candidates.
2. **Phase 2 Review**: Evaluation of theoretical knowledge and understanding.
3. **Practical Assessment**: Evaluation of applied skills and competence.
4. **Post-Assessment**: Debriefing, feedback, and evaluation of the assessment process.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in the 125. Phase 2 Review and Practical Assessment include:
* **Simulation-based assessment**: The use of simulated scenarios to evaluate practical skills and competence.
* **Case study-based assessment**: The use of real-world case studies to evaluate decision-making and problem-solving skills.
* **Peer review**: The use of peer assessors to evaluate and provide feedback on performance.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in the 125. Phase 2 Review and Practical Assessment include:
* **Lack of standardization**: Failure to establish clear, consistent evaluation criteria and processes.
* **Insufficient feedback**: Failure to provide timely, constructive feedback to candidates.
* **Bias and subjectivity**: Introduction of personal biases or subjective judgments into the evaluation process.
