# 94. Notebook Run Command

Canonical documentation for 94. Notebook Run Command. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
The 94. Notebook Run Command exists to provide a standardized method for executing notebooks in a controlled and reproducible manner. It addresses the class of problems related to notebook execution, such as inconsistent runtime environments, lack of transparency in execution parameters, and difficulties in reproducing results. By providing a well-defined interface for running notebooks, the 94. Notebook Run Command aims to increase the reliability, efficiency, and collaboration among data scientists, researchers, and developers.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
The 94. Notebook Run Command is a high-level abstraction that encapsulates the complexities of notebook execution. It provides a simple, yet powerful interface for running notebooks, allowing users to focus on the logic and content of their notebooks rather than the underlying execution details. The conceptual model revolves around the idea of a notebook as a self-contained, executable unit that can be run in a variety of environments, including local machines, remote servers, and cloud platforms.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Notebook | A self-contained, executable document that contains a sequence of cells, each containing code, markup, or other content. |
| Cell | A single unit of execution within a notebook, which can contain code, markup, or other content. |
| Kernel | The runtime environment in which a notebook is executed, responsible for executing cells and managing the notebook's state. |
| Runtime Environment | The combination of software, libraries, and dependencies required to execute a notebook. |
| Execution Parameters | The set of inputs, configuration options, and other settings that control the execution of a notebook. |

## 4. Core Concepts
The 94. Notebook Run Command is built around several fundamental ideas:
* **Notebook as a first-class citizen**: Notebooks are treated as self-contained, executable units that can be run, shared, and collaborated on.
* **Kernel-agnostic execution**: The 94. Notebook Run Command provides a kernel-agnostic interface, allowing notebooks to be executed in a variety of runtime environments.
* **Transparent execution parameters**: The command provides a clear and transparent way to specify execution parameters, making it easier to reproduce results and collaborate with others.
* **Flexible execution modes**: The command supports various execution modes, including local, remote, and cloud-based execution.

## 5. Standard Model
The standard model for the 94. Notebook Run Command involves the following components:
* **Notebook**: The notebook to be executed, containing a sequence of cells with code, markup, or other content.
* **Kernel**: The runtime environment in which the notebook is executed, responsible for executing cells and managing the notebook's state.
* **Execution Parameters**: The set of inputs, configuration options, and other settings that control the execution of the notebook.
* **Output**: The result of executing the notebook, which can include output cells, logs, and other artifacts.

## 6. Common Patterns
Common patterns for using the 94. Notebook Run Command include:
* **Local execution**: Running notebooks on a local machine for development, testing, and debugging.
* **Remote execution**: Running notebooks on a remote server or cloud platform for production, deployment, or collaboration.
* **Batch execution**: Running multiple notebooks in batch mode for automated testing, validation, or data processing.
* **Interactive execution**: Running notebooks in interactive mode for exploratory data analysis, prototyping, or education.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Common anti-patterns to avoid when using the 94. Notebook Run Command include:
* **Hardcoding execution parameters**: Failing to specify execution parameters explicitly, leading to inconsistent or unreproducible results.
* **Ignoring kernel dependencies**: Failing to manage kernel dependencies, leading to runtime errors or inconsistencies.
* **Overlooking output artifacts**: Failing to capture or manage output artifacts, leading to lost or corrupted results.
