> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 95. Passing Parameters Between Notebooks exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The primary purpose of passing parameters between notebooks is to facilitate data exchange, enable modular code development, and promote reusability of computational workflows. This functionality addresses the class of problems related to data siloing, code duplication, and workflow fragmentation, which can hinder collaboration, scalability, and maintainability in data science and scientific computing applications.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Passing parameters between notebooks involves a paradigm where individual notebooks, each representing a self-contained computational unit, can exchange data and control information through well-defined interfaces. This enables the creation of complex workflows by composing multiple notebooks, each focusing on a specific task, while allowing for flexibility, adaptability, and ease of maintenance.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Notebook | A web-based interactive computing environment that supports the creation of documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. |
| Parameter | A variable or value passed to a notebook to influence its execution or output. |
| Interface | A defined boundary across which notebooks exchange parameters, data, or control information. |
| Workflow | A series of notebooks or computational tasks arranged to achieve a specific outcome or process data from start to finish. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts include parameter passing mechanisms (e.g., URL parameters, file-based exchange), interface definitions (e.g., APIs, data formats), and workflow management (e.g., sequencing, conditional execution). Understanding these concepts is crucial for designing and implementing effective notebook-based workflows.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for passing parameters between notebooks involves using a combination of URL parameters for simple cases and more sophisticated interfaces like REST APIs or message queues for complex workflows. This model emphasizes the importance of clear interface definitions, robust error handling, and comprehensive documentation to ensure interoperability and maintainability.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns include using a central data repository for parameter storage and retrieval, implementing a publish-subscribe model for real-time data exchange, and leveraging workflow management tools to orchestrate notebook execution. These patterns help in creating scalable, efficient, and collaborative computational environments.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns include hardcoding parameters within notebooks, using tightly coupled interfaces that hinder flexibility, and neglecting error handling and logging mechanisms. These practices can lead to brittle workflows, increased maintenance costs, and decreased collaboration among users.
