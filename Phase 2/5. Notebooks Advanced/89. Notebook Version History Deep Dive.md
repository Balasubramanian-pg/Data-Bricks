# 89. Notebook Version History Deep Dive

Canonical documentation for 89. Notebook Version History Deep Dive. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 89. Notebook Version History Deep Dive exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The 89. Notebook Version History Deep Dive is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the evolution of notebooks, addressing the need for version control, collaboration, and change tracking in notebook development. This deep dive aims to equip users with the knowledge to effectively manage and analyze the history of their notebooks, ensuring data integrity, reproducibility, and transparency.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The 89. Notebook Version History Deep Dive revolves around the concept of a notebook as a dynamic, iterative document that undergoes multiple revisions. This mental model encompasses the idea of a version history, which is a record of all changes made to the notebook over time. The version history is composed of a sequence of snapshots, each representing a specific state of the notebook at a particular point in time.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Notebook | A digital document that contains a collection of cells, such as code, text, and images, used for data analysis, visualization, and presentation. |
| Version History | A record of all changes made to a notebook over time, including the addition, modification, or deletion of cells, as well as changes to cell contents. |
| Snapshot | A specific state of a notebook at a particular point in time, representing a single version in the version history. |
| Cell | A basic unit of content in a notebook, which can contain code, text, images, or other media. |
| Revision | A change or update made to a notebook, resulting in a new version or snapshot. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of the 89. Notebook Version History Deep Dive include:
* **Versioning**: The process of tracking changes to a notebook over time, creating a sequence of versions or snapshots.
* **Change tracking**: The ability to identify and record changes made to a notebook, including additions, modifications, and deletions.
* **Collaboration**: The ability for multiple users to work on a notebook simultaneously, with changes tracked and recorded in the version history.
* **Reproducibility**: The ability to recreate a specific state of a notebook, using the version history to ensure that results can be verified and replicated.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for notebook version history involves the use of a centralized repository, such as a version control system, to store and manage the version history of a notebook. This repository provides a single source of truth for the notebook's version history, allowing users to track changes, collaborate, and reproduce results.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in notebook version history include:
* **Linear versioning**: A sequence of versions, each building on the previous one, with a clear and linear progression.
* **Branching and merging**: The creation of separate branches or forks, allowing users to work on different versions of a notebook, and then merging changes back into the main branch.
* **Tagging and release management**: The use of tags or labels to mark specific versions or snapshots, and the management of releases or deployments.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in notebook version history include:
* **Uncontrolled changes**: Making changes to a notebook without tracking or recording them, leading to lost work and irreproducible results.
* **Unmanaged collaboration**: Allowing multiple users to work on a notebook without proper change tracking or collaboration tools, leading to conflicts and inconsistencies.
* **Inadequate versioning**: Failing to maintain a complete and accurate version history, making it difficult to track changes or reproduce results.
