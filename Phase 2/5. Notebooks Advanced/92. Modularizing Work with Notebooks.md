> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 92. Modularizing Work with Notebooks exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Modularizing work with notebooks exists to address the challenges of managing complex, interconnected tasks and projects. It provides a structured approach to organizing work, facilitating collaboration, and enhancing productivity. The primary problems it addresses include information overload, lack of standardization, and inefficient knowledge sharing.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual model of modularizing work with notebooks revolves around the idea of breaking down large tasks into smaller, manageable modules. These modules are then organized into notebooks, which serve as centralized hubs for related information. This approach enables users to focus on specific aspects of a project, collaborate with others, and maintain a clear overview of the entire workflow.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Notebook | A digital or physical container for organizing and storing related information, notes, and tasks. |
| Module | A self-contained unit of work or a specific task that contributes to a larger project or goal. |
| Tag | A keyword or label used to categorize and filter modules or notebooks. |
| Link | A reference or connection between modules, notebooks, or external resources. |
| Template | A pre-designed structure or format for creating new notebooks or modules. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of modularizing work with notebooks include:
* **Modularity**: Breaking down complex tasks into smaller, independent modules.
* **Organization**: Structuring modules and notebooks using tags, links, and templates.
* **Collaboration**: Sharing notebooks and modules with others to facilitate teamwork and knowledge sharing.
* **Flexibility**: Adapting notebooks and modules to changing project requirements or workflows.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for modularizing work with notebooks involves:
1. Creating a notebook for each project or topic.
2. Breaking down large tasks into smaller modules.
3. Organizing modules using tags, links, and templates.
4. Establishing a consistent naming convention and folder structure.
5. Regularly reviewing and updating notebooks to ensure accuracy and relevance.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in modularizing work with notebooks include:
* **Daily or weekly review**: Regularly reviewing notebooks to update tasks, reflect on progress, and plan upcoming work.
* **Meeting notes**: Using notebooks to record and organize meeting notes, action items, and decisions.
* **Project planning**: Creating notebooks to plan and manage projects, including setting goals, tracking progress, and identifying dependencies.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in modularizing work with notebooks include:
* **Information duplication**: Duplicating information across multiple notebooks or modules, leading to inconsistencies and maintenance issues.
* **Lack of standardization**: Failing to establish a consistent naming convention, folder structure, or tagging system, making it difficult to navigate and search notebooks.
* **Insufficient review and update**: Neglecting to regularly review and update notebooks, resulting in outdated or irrelevant information.
