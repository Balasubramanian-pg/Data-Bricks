# 100. Notebook Code Review Guidelines

Canonical documentation for 100. Notebook Code Review Guidelines. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 100. Notebook Code Review Guidelines exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The 100. Notebook Code Review Guidelines exist to ensure that notebooks containing code are thoroughly reviewed, maintaining high standards of quality, readability, and functionality. This guideline addresses the class of problems related to code quality, collaboration, and knowledge sharing among developers, data scientists, and researchers. The primary issues it tackles include inconsistent coding practices, inadequate documentation, and the lack of standardization in notebook development.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of the 100. Notebook Code Review Guidelines involves a systematic approach to evaluating notebooks. This includes assessing code organization, syntax, and best practices, as well as the clarity and completeness of documentation. It also encompasses the review of data handling, analysis, and visualization techniques to ensure they are appropriate and effectively implemented. The guidelines promote a culture of transparency, reproducibility, and continuous improvement in notebook development.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Notebook | A document that contains a mixture of text, code, and visualizations, used for data analysis, machine learning, and scientific computing. |
| Code Review | The systematic examination of computer source code, intended to find and fix mistakes, improve code quality, and ensure adherence to coding standards. |
| Reproducibility | The ability of an entire experiment or study to be duplicated, either by the same researcher or by someone else working independently. |
| Readability | The quality of being easy to read and understand, applying to both code and documentation within a notebook. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of the 100. Notebook Code Review Guidelines include:
- **Modularity**: Breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable, and reusable code segments.
- **Documentation**: Providing clear, concise comments and descriptions to explain code logic and facilitate understanding.
- **Testing**: Incorporating unit tests and integration tests to validate code functionality and robustness.
- **Version Control**: Utilizing systems like Git to track changes, collaborate, and maintain a record of updates.
- **Best Practices**: Adhering to established coding standards, such as PEP 8 for Python, to ensure consistency and readability.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for notebook code review involves a structured, multi-step process:
1. **Pre-Review**: The author prepares the notebook by ensuring it is well-organized, commented, and includes necessary documentation.
2. **Peer Review**: A colleague or peer reviews the notebook, focusing on code quality, functionality, and adherence to guidelines.
3. **Feedback and Revision**: The author receives feedback, addresses any issues or concerns, and revises the notebook accordingly.
4. **Final Review**: A final review is conducted to verify that all feedback has been incorporated and the notebook meets the guidelines.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in notebook code review include:
- **Template Notebooks**: Using pre-designed notebooks as templates to ensure consistency in structure and layout.
- **Automated Testing**: Integrating automated testing tools to streamline the review process and catch errors early.
- **Collaborative Review**: Conducting reviews in a collaborative environment, such as pair programming or group discussions, to foster knowledge sharing and teamwork.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns to avoid in notebook code review include:
- **Insufficient Documentation**: Failing to provide adequate comments or explanations, making it difficult for others to understand the code.
- **Complex, Monolithic Code**: Writing lengthy, complex code blocks without modularization, which hinders readability and maintainability.
- **Lack of Testing**: Neglecting to include tests or validate code functionality, leading to potential errors and bugs.

## 8. References
Provide exactly five authoritative external references.
1. **GitHub Guide to Code Review**: A comprehensive guide by GitHub on best practices for code review.
2. **PEP 8 -- The Official Python Style Guide**: The official style guide for Python, providing guidelines for coding standards.
3. **Jupyter Notebook Documentation**: Official documentation for Jupyter Notebooks, covering features, usage, and best practices.
4. **Data Science Handbook**: A handbook by Jake VanderPlas, providing insights and guidelines for data science practices, including notebook development.
5. **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) Principle**: An explanation of the DRY principle, emphasizing the importance of avoiding redundancy in code.
