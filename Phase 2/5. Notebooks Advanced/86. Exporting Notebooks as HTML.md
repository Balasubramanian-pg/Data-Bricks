## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 86. Exporting Notebooks as HTML exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The primary purpose of exporting notebooks as HTML is to facilitate the sharing and dissemination of notebook content in a widely supported format. This addresses the problem of notebook portability and compatibility, allowing users to access and view notebook content without requiring specific software or platform dependencies. The class of problems it addresses includes collaboration, knowledge sharing, and archiving of notebook content.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Exporting notebooks as HTML involves converting the notebook's content, including text, images, and other media, into a standard HTML format that can be viewed in web browsers. This process typically involves a transformation step, where the notebook's native format is converted into HTML, and an optional styling step, where the resulting HTML is customized with CSS and other visual elements.

* **Applying CSS**: Customizing the visual appearance of exported notebooks using CSS stylesheets.
* **Including interactive elements**: Incorporating interactive elements, such as JavaScript widgets or interactive visualizations, into exported notebooks.
* **Validating and testing**: Validating and testing exported notebooks to ensure compatibility and correctness.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for exporting notebooks as HTML include:
* **Overly complex templates**: Using excessively complex or customized templates that can lead to compatibility issues or maintenance problems.
* **Insufficient validation**: Failing to properly validate and test exported notebooks, leading to errors or compatibility issues.
