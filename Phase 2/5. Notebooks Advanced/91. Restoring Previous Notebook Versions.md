# 91. Restoring Previous Notebook Versions

Canonical documentation for 91. Restoring Previous Notebook Versions. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 91. Restoring Previous Notebook Versions exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of restoring previous notebook versions is to provide a safety net for users who have made unintended changes or encountered data corruption. This feature addresses the problem of data loss and version control in collaborative or personal notebook environments. By allowing users to revert to previous versions, it mitigates the risk of losing important information and enables a more efficient workflow.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual model of restoring previous notebook versions involves a version control system that tracks changes made to a notebook over time. Each time a user saves a notebook, a new version is created, and the previous version is archived. This allows users to browse through a history of changes and restore any previous version as needed. The model assumes that each version is a snapshot of the notebook's state at a particular point in time.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Version | A snapshot of a notebook's state at a particular point in time. |
| Revision | A specific iteration of a notebook that has been saved. |
| Restore | The act of reverting a notebook to a previous version. |
| Archive | A collection of previous notebook versions. |
| Checkpoint | A manually created snapshot of a notebook's state. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of restoring previous notebook versions include version control, change tracking, and data archiving. Version control is the process of managing different versions of a notebook, while change tracking involves monitoring the changes made to a notebook over time. Data archiving refers to the storage of previous notebook versions for potential future use.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for restoring previous notebook versions involves the following steps:
1. Create a new version of the notebook each time it is saved.
2. Store each version in an archive.
3. Provide a user interface for browsing and restoring previous versions.
4. Allow users to create manual checkpoints.
5. Implement data validation and integrity checks to ensure the accuracy of restored versions.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for restoring previous notebook versions include:
* Regularly saving notebooks to create new versions.
* Using manual checkpoints to mark important milestones.
* Browsing the version history to track changes.
* Restoring previous versions to recover from unintended changes or data corruption.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for restoring previous notebook versions include:
* Failing to regularly save notebooks, resulting in a lack of version history.
* Not using manual checkpoints, making it difficult to track important changes.
* Relying solely on automatic versioning, without verifying the integrity of restored versions.
* Not testing restored versions, which can lead to further data corruption or loss.
