> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 88. Exporting Notebooks as Source Files exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of exporting notebooks as source files is to provide a way to save and share notebook content in a format that can be easily edited, version-controlled, and collaborated on by multiple users. This addresses the problem of notebook content being locked in a specific platform or format, making it difficult to work with others or integrate with existing workflows.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Exporting notebooks as source files involves converting the notebook content into a plain text format, such as Markdown or HTML, that can be easily read and edited by humans. This process typically involves stripping away any proprietary formatting or metadata, leaving only the essential content and structure of the notebook.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Notebook | A collection of notes, cells, or pages that contain content such as text, images, and code |
| Source File | A plain text file that contains the content and structure of a notebook, often in a format such as Markdown or HTML |
| Export | The process of converting a notebook into a source file format |
| Import | The process of converting a source file back into a notebook format |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of exporting notebooks as source files include:
* **Content preservation**: The goal of preserving the original content and structure of the notebook during the export process
* **Format conversion**: The process of converting the notebook content into a plain text format
* **Metadata stripping**: The removal of proprietary metadata or formatting during the export process

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for exporting notebooks as source files involves the following steps:
1. **Notebook preparation**: Preparing the notebook for export by cleaning up any unnecessary content or formatting
2. **Export options**: Selecting the desired export options, such as the output format and any additional metadata to include
3. **Export process**: Converting the notebook content into the selected output format
4. **Post-export review**: Reviewing the exported source file to ensure that the content and structure have been preserved

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for exporting notebooks as source files include:
* **Markdown export**: Exporting notebooks as Markdown files for easy editing and collaboration
* **HTML export**: Exporting notebooks as HTML files for web-based sharing and presentation
* **Version control integration**: Integrating exported source files with version control systems, such as Git, for collaborative editing and tracking changes

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for exporting notebooks as source files include:
* **Proprietary format lock-in**: Exporting notebooks in a proprietary format that is difficult to edit or collaborate on
* **Insufficient metadata**: Failing to include essential metadata, such as author information or creation dates, during the export process
* **Inconsistent formatting**: Using inconsistent formatting or styling during the export process, making it difficult to read or edit the source file
