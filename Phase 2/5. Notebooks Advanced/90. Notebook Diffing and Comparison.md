# 90. Notebook Diffing and Comparison

Canonical documentation for 90. Notebook Diffing and Comparison. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 90. Notebook Diffing and Comparison exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The primary purpose of Notebook Diffing and Comparison is to provide a systematic approach to identifying and managing changes between different versions of notebooks, which are essentially documents that contain a mixture of code, narrative text, and visualizations. This capability is crucial in collaborative data science and scientific computing environments, where multiple stakeholders may work on the same notebook, and changes need to be tracked, understood, and potentially reverted. The class of problems it addresses includes version control, change management, and collaboration in notebook-based workflows.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Notebook Diffing and Comparison involves treating notebooks as first-class citizens in a version control system, similar to source code files. This means that each notebook is considered a distinct entity that can be versioned, diffed, and compared. The process typically involves parsing the notebook's internal structure, identifying changes at the cell level (including code, markdown, and output cells), and presenting these changes in a human-readable format. This high-level overview encompasses the core idea of managing notebook evolution through systematic comparison and versioning.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Notebook | A document that contains a sequence of cells, which can be code cells, markdown cells, or output cells, used for data analysis, visualization, and narrative text. |
| Diffing | The process of comparing two versions of a notebook to identify changes, additions, or deletions. |
| Comparison | The act of examining the differences between two or more versions of a notebook to understand the evolution or changes made. |
| Cell | A basic unit within a notebook that can contain code, markdown text, or output. |
| Version Control | A system that helps you manage changes to notebooks (or other files) over time, allowing you to keep a record of all changes and revert to previous versions if necessary. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Notebook Diffing and Comparison include:
- **Versioning**: The ability to manage different versions of a notebook.
- **Cell-Level Diffing**: Comparing changes at the level of individual cells within a notebook.
- **Change Visualization**: Presenting the differences between notebook versions in a clear, understandable format.
- **Collaboration**: Enabling multiple users to work on a notebook, with features to manage and merge changes.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Notebook Diffing and Comparison typically involves the following steps:
1. **Parsing**: Breaking down the notebook into its constituent parts (cells).
2. **Comparison**: Identifying changes between two versions of the notebook at the cell level.
3. **Diffing**: Generating a human-readable representation of the changes found.
4. **Visualization**: Displaying the diffs in a user-friendly format to facilitate understanding and decision-making.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in Notebook Diffing and Comparison include:
- **Regular Versioning**: Frequently saving new versions of a notebook as changes are made.
- **Collaborative Review**: Using diffing and comparison tools to review changes made by collaborators before merging them into a main branch.
- **Change Tracking**: Systematically tracking changes over time to maintain a clear history of a notebook's evolution.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in Notebook Diffing and Comparison include:
- **Infrequent Versioning**: Not regularly saving new versions of a notebook, leading to difficulty in tracking changes.
- **Manual Comparison**: Manually comparing notebooks without the use of diffing tools, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors.
- **Ignoring History**: Failing to maintain a change history, making it difficult to understand how a notebook evolved over time.
