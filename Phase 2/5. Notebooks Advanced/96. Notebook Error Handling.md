# 96. Notebook Error Handling

Canonical documentation for 96. Notebook Error Handling. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 96. Notebook Error Handling exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The 96. Notebook Error Handling mechanism is designed to provide a robust and reliable way to handle errors that occur during the execution of notebook cells. The primary purpose of this mechanism is to prevent notebook crashes, data loss, and other undesirable consequences that can result from unhandled errors. The class of problems addressed by this mechanism includes syntax errors, runtime errors, and other exceptions that can occur during the execution of notebook code.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The 96. Notebook Error Handling mechanism is based on a try-except-finally block model, where each cell in the notebook is executed within a try block, and any errors that occur are caught and handled by an except block. The finally block is used to perform any necessary cleanup or recovery actions. This model provides a flexible and extensible way to handle errors, allowing developers to customize the error handling behavior to suit their specific needs.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Cell | A single unit of execution in a notebook, typically containing a block of code. |
| Error | An exception or other runtime anomaly that occurs during the execution of a cell. |
| Exception | A runtime error that occurs during the execution of a cell, such as a syntax error or a division by zero error. |
| Handler | A block of code that is executed in response to an error or exception, used to perform error handling and recovery actions. |
| Notebook | A collection of cells, each containing a block of code, that are executed in a specific order to produce a desired outcome. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of 96. Notebook Error Handling include:
* **Error detection**: The ability to detect errors and exceptions that occur during the execution of notebook cells.
* **Error handling**: The ability to respond to errors and exceptions in a way that prevents notebook crashes, data loss, and other undesirable consequences.
* **Recovery**: The ability to recover from errors and exceptions, and to resume execution of the notebook from a known good state.
* **Customization**: The ability to customize the error handling behavior to suit specific needs and requirements.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for 96. Notebook Error Handling involves the use of a try-except-finally block structure, where each cell in the notebook is executed within a try block, and any errors that occur are caught and handled by an except block. The finally block is used to perform any necessary cleanup or recovery actions. This model provides a flexible and extensible way to handle errors, allowing developers to customize the error handling behavior to suit their specific needs.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for 96. Notebook Error Handling include:
* **Try-except-finally block structure**: Using a try-except-finally block structure to handle errors and exceptions that occur during the execution of notebook cells.
* **Error logging**: Logging errors and exceptions to a log file or other persistent storage, to facilitate debugging and troubleshooting.
* **Recovery actions**: Performing recovery actions, such as rolling back changes or restoring previous state, to recover from errors and exceptions.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for 96. Notebook Error Handling include:
* **Ignoring errors**: Ignoring errors and exceptions, rather than handling them in a way that prevents notebook crashes, data loss, and other undesirable consequences.
* **Using bare except clauses**: Using bare except clauses, which can catch and handle exceptions that are not intended to be caught, such as system-exiting exceptions.
* **Not logging errors**: Not logging errors and exceptions, making it difficult to debug and troubleshoot issues.
