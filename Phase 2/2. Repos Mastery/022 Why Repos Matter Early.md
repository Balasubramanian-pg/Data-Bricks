# Why Repos Matter Early

Canonical documentation for Why Repos Matter Early. This document defines concepts, terminology, and standard usage.

## Purpose

Describe why this topic exists and what problem space it addresses. This section should be descriptive, not instructional.

The importance of repositories (repos) early in a project's lifecycle cannot be overstated. As the central location for storing and managing code, repos play a crucial role in facilitating collaboration, version control, and issue tracking. By establishing a well-structured repo early on, development teams can avoid common pitfalls, such as disorganized codebases, duplicated effort, and integration headaches. This topic exists to highlight the benefits of prioritizing repos from the outset and to provide guidance on best practices for creating and maintaining them.

## Scope

Clarify what is in scope and out of scope for this topic.

**In scope:**
* Repository structure and organization
* Version control systems and workflows
* Collaboration and issue tracking best practices

**Out of scope:**
* Tool-specific implementations (e.g., Git, SVN, Mercurial)
* Vendor-specific behavior (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)
* Project management methodologies (e.g., Agile, Waterfall)

## Definitions

Provide precise definitions for key terms used throughout the documentation.

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Repository (Repo) | A centralized location for storing and managing code, documentation, and other project assets. |
| Version Control System (VCS) | A system that helps track changes to code, documents, or other digital content over time. |
| Collaboration | The process of working together with others to achieve a common goal, often facilitated by tools and workflows. |

> [!TIP]
> Definitions should be stable over time; avoid contextual language.

## Core Concepts

Explain the fundamental ideas that make up the topic.

### Concept One: Repository Structure
A well-organized repository is essential for efficient collaboration and version control. This includes creating a logical directory structure, establishing clear naming conventions, and defining access controls.

### Concept Two: Version Control Workflows
Effective version control workflows enable teams to manage changes, track issues, and collaborate on code. This involves understanding branching strategies, merge workflows, and commit best practices.

## Standard Model

Describe the generally accepted or recommended model for this topic.

The standard model for repository management involves establishing a centralized repository, using a version control system, and implementing a collaboration workflow. This includes:

1. Creating a repository with a clear structure and organization
2. Defining access controls and permissions
3. Establishing a version control workflow (e.g., Git Flow, GitHub Flow)
4. Implementing collaboration tools (e.g., issue tracking, project management)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deviations from the standard model should be explicitly documented and justified.

## Common Patterns

Document recurring patterns or approaches associated with this topic.

* Pattern A: Using a single repository for multiple projects
* Pattern B: Implementing a monorepo architecture for large-scale projects

## Anti-Patterns

Describe common mistakes or discouraged practices.

> [!WARNING]
> These anti-patterns often lead to maintenance or scalability issues.

* Anti-pattern A: Using a decentralized repository structure without clear access controls
* Anti-pattern B: Failing to establish a consistent version control workflow

## Edge Cases

Explain unusual, ambiguous, or boundary scenarios related to the topic.

> [!CAUTION]
> Edge cases are frequently overlooked and may cause incorrect assumptions.

* Edge case: Managing repositories with large binary files or assets
* Edge case: Integrating repositories with external systems or services
