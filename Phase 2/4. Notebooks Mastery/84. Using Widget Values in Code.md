# 84. Using Widget Values in Code

Canonical documentation for 84. Using Widget Values in Code. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 84. Using Widget Values in Code exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of using widget values in code is to enable dynamic and interactive user interfaces, where the values of widgets such as buttons, text fields, and checkboxes can be accessed and manipulated programmatically. This addresses the problem of creating responsive and engaging user experiences, where the application's behavior is determined by user input and interactions.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual model of using widget values in code involves a widget hierarchy, where each widget has a set of properties and values that can be accessed and modified. The application's code can then use these values to perform actions, update the user interface, and respond to user input. This model assumes a event-driven programming paradigm, where the application's behavior is determined by user interactions and events.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Widget | A graphical user interface component, such as a button or text field. |
| Widget Value | The current state or value of a widget, such as the text entered in a text field. |
| Event | A user interaction or action, such as a button click or key press. |
| Event Handler | A function or method that responds to an event and performs an action. |
| Binding | The process of linking a widget's value to a variable or property in the application's code. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of using widget values in code include:
* **Widget properties**: Each widget has a set of properties, such as text, color, and size, that can be accessed and modified.
* **Event-driven programming**: The application's behavior is determined by user interactions and events, which trigger event handlers to perform actions.
* **Binding**: The process of linking a widget's value to a variable or property in the application's code, allowing the application to respond to changes in the widget's value.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for using widget values in code involves the following steps:
1. Create a widget hierarchy, where each widget has a set of properties and values.
2. Define event handlers to respond to user interactions and events.
3. Bind the widget's value to a variable or property in the application's code.
4. Use the bound value to perform actions and update the user interface.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for using widget values in code include:
* **Data binding**: Binding a widget's value to a variable or property in the application's code, allowing the application to respond to changes in the widget's value.
* **Event handling**: Defining event handlers to respond to user interactions and events, such as button clicks or key presses.
* **Widget validation**: Validating user input and widget values to ensure they meet certain criteria or constraints.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for using widget values in code include:
* **Tight coupling**: Tightly coupling the widget's value to a specific implementation or technology, making it difficult to change or replace.
* **Magic numbers**: Using hardcoded or "magic" numbers to represent widget values, rather than using named constants or variables.
* **Unnecessary complexity**: Introducing unnecessary complexity or overhead when using widget values in code, such as using overly complex data structures or algorithms.
