> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 83. Creating Multiselect Widgets exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of creating multiselect widgets is to provide users with the ability to select multiple options from a list, addressing the problem of limited input options in traditional select elements. This is particularly useful in scenarios where users need to choose multiple items, such as filtering data, selecting multiple categories, or choosing multiple options from a list.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
A multiselect widget is a graphical user interface (GUI) element that allows users to select multiple options from a list. It typically consists of a dropdown or popup list containing checkboxes or other selection mechanisms, enabling users to choose multiple items. The conceptual model involves a container element, a list of options, and a selection mechanism, which can be implemented using various technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Multiselect Widget | A GUI element that allows users to select multiple options from a list. |
| Option | A single item in the list that can be selected. |
| Selection Mechanism | The method used to select options, such as checkboxes or radio buttons. |
| Container Element | The HTML element that contains the multiselect widget. |
| Dropdown List | A list of options that appears when the user clicks on the multiselect widget. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of creating multiselect widgets include:
* **Option rendering**: The process of generating the list of options and rendering them in the GUI.
* **Selection handling**: The mechanism for handling user input and updating the selection state.
* **Accessibility**: Ensuring that the multiselect widget is accessible to users with disabilities.
* **Styling and layout**: Customizing the appearance and layout of the multiselect widget.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for creating multiselect widgets involves using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML structure typically consists of a container element, a list of options, and a selection mechanism. CSS is used to style the widget, while JavaScript is used to handle user input and update the selection state.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for creating multiselect widgets include:
* **Using checkboxes as the selection mechanism**: Checkboxes are a common choice for multiselect widgets, as they provide a clear visual indication of selection state.
* **Implementing keyboard navigation**: Allowing users to navigate the list of options using the keyboard improves accessibility and usability.
* **Providing a search function**: Adding a search function to the multiselect widget enables users to quickly find specific options.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for creating multiselect widgets include:
* **Using a single select element with multiple attributes**: This approach can lead to confusing and difficult-to-use interfaces.
* **Not providing a clear visual indication of selection state**: Failing to provide a clear visual indication of selection state can lead to user confusion and errors.
* **Not implementing accessibility features**: Failing to implement accessibility features, such as keyboard navigation and screen reader support, can make the widget unusable for users with disabilities.
