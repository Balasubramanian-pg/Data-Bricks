# 77. Running Cells Individually

Canonical documentation for 77. Running Cells Individually. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 77. Running Cells Individually exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of running cells individually is to enable the execution of a single cell within a larger computational notebook or workflow, allowing for incremental development, testing, and debugging of code segments. This approach addresses the problem of having to execute an entire notebook or workflow to test a specific cell, which can be time-consuming and inefficient. By running cells individually, developers can isolate and test specific code segments, reducing the overall development and debugging time.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Running cells individually involves executing a single cell within a computational notebook or workflow, while maintaining the context and state of the surrounding cells. This approach requires a deep understanding of the dependencies and relationships between cells, as well as the ability to manage the execution of individual cells within a larger workflow.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Cell | A single unit of execution within a computational notebook or workflow, typically containing a segment of code. |
| Notebook | A collection of cells that are executed in a specific order to produce a desired output. |
| Workflow | A series of connected cells that are executed in a specific order to produce a desired output. |
| Execution Context | The environment and state in which a cell is executed, including variables, dependencies, and other relevant factors. |
| Dependency Management | The process of managing the relationships and dependencies between cells, to ensure that cells are executed in the correct order and with the correct context. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of running cells individually include:
* Cell isolation: The ability to execute a single cell within a larger notebook or workflow, without affecting the surrounding cells.
* Dependency management: The process of managing the relationships and dependencies between cells, to ensure that cells are executed in the correct order and with the correct context.
* Execution context: The environment and state in which a cell is executed, including variables, dependencies, and other relevant factors.
* Incremental development: The ability to develop and test code segments incrementally, without having to execute the entire notebook or workflow.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for running cells individually involves:
1. Identifying the cell to be executed: Selecting the specific cell to be executed, based on the requirements of the development or debugging process.
2. Managing dependencies: Ensuring that the dependencies and relationships between cells are properly managed, to ensure that the cell is executed in the correct context.
3. Executing the cell: Executing the selected cell, using the managed dependencies and execution context.
4. Verifying the results: Verifying that the results of the cell execution are as expected, and making any necessary adjustments to the code or dependencies.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for running cells individually include:
* Incremental development: Developing and testing code segments incrementally, using individual cell execution to verify the results of each segment.
* Debugging: Using individual cell execution to isolate and debug specific code segments, reducing the overall debugging time and effort.
* Testing: Using individual cell execution to test specific code segments, reducing the overall testing time and effort.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for running cells individually include:
* Executing entire notebooks or workflows unnecessarily: Executing entire notebooks or workflows, when only a single cell needs to be executed, resulting in wasted time and resources.
* Ignoring dependencies: Ignoring the dependencies and relationships between cells, resulting in incorrect or unexpected results.
* Not verifying results: Not verifying the results of cell execution, resulting in undetected errors or issues.
