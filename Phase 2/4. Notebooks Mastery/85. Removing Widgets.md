## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 85. Removing Widgets exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of removing widgets is to provide a mechanism for users to delete or uninstall unwanted or unused widgets from their interface, thereby improving overall user experience, reducing clutter, and enhancing system performance. The problem space addressed by removing widgets includes user interface management, widget lifecycle management, and system resource optimization.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of removing widgets involves a simple, intuitive process that allows users to select and delete widgets, with optional features such as confirmation prompts, undo functionality, and widget replacement suggestions. The process typically involves a few key steps: widget selection, removal confirmation, and post-removal feedback.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Widget | A self-contained, reusable piece of code that provides a specific functionality or service |
| Removal | The act of deleting or uninstalling a widget from the user interface |
| Interface | The point of interaction between the user and the system, including the layout, design, and organization of widgets |
| Lifecycle | The series of stages a widget goes through, from creation to removal |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of removing widgets include: 
1. **Widget management**: The process of creating, configuring, and deleting widgets.
2. **User interface optimization**: The practice of streamlining the user interface to improve user experience and system performance.
3. **Resource allocation**: The management of system resources, such as memory and processing power, to ensure efficient widget operation.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for removing widgets involves a simple, step-by-step process:
1. **Widget selection**: The user selects the widget to be removed.
2. **Removal confirmation**: The system prompts the user to confirm the removal.
3. **Widget deletion**: The system deletes the widget and updates the user interface.
4. **Post-removal feedback**: The system provides feedback to the user, such as a confirmation message or a updated interface.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for removing widgets include:
* **Drag-and-drop removal**: The user drags the widget to a designated removal area.
* **Context menu removal**: The user right-clicks on the widget and selects a removal option.
* **Button-based removal**: The user clicks a dedicated removal button.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for removing widgets include:
* **Forced removal**: The system removes widgets without user consent or confirmation.
* **Hidden removal**: The system removes widgets without providing clear feedback or notification.
* **Irreversible removal**: The system removes widgets without providing an option for recovery or undo.
