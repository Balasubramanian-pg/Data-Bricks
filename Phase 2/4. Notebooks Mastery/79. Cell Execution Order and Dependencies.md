Canonical documentation for 79. Cell Execution Order and Dependencies. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 79. Cell Execution Order and Dependencies exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of Cell Execution Order and Dependencies is to manage the order in which cells are executed in a computational environment, such as a Jupyter Notebook or a spreadsheet. This is crucial in ensuring that cells with dependencies are executed in the correct order, preventing errors and inconsistencies. The class of problems it addresses includes data inconsistency, incorrect results, and difficulties in reproducing computations.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual model of Cell Execution Order and Dependencies involves a directed graph, where each cell is a node, and the edges represent dependencies between cells. The execution order is determined by traversing the graph, ensuring that each cell is executed only after its dependencies have been executed.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Cell | A unit of computation, such as a code block or a formula, that can be executed independently. |
| Dependency | A relationship between two cells, where the execution of one cell depends on the output or result of another cell. |
| Execution Order | The sequence in which cells are executed, taking into account their dependencies. |
| Directed Graph | A graph where the edges have direction, representing the dependencies between cells. |
| Topological Sorting | The process of ordering the nodes in a directed graph such that for every edge (u,v), node u comes before v in the ordering. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Cell Execution Order and Dependencies include:
* Cells as units of computation
* Dependencies between cells
* Execution order as a sequence of cell executions
* Directed graphs as a representation of cell dependencies
* Topological sorting as a method for determining the execution order

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Cell Execution Order and Dependencies involves the following steps:
1. Define the cells and their dependencies
2. Construct a directed graph representing the cell dependencies
3. Perform a topological sorting on the graph to determine the execution order
4. Execute the cells in the determined order

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in Cell Execution Order and Dependencies include:
* Linear execution: cells are executed in a linear sequence, with each cell depending on the previous one
* Tree-like execution: cells are executed in a tree-like structure, with each cell depending on one or more parent cells
* Cyclic execution: cells are executed in a cyclic structure, with each cell depending on one or more cells that also depend on it

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in Cell Execution Order and Dependencies include:
* Ignoring dependencies: executing cells without considering their dependencies
* Circular dependencies: creating dependencies between cells that form a cycle
* Unnecessary dependencies: creating dependencies between cells that are not necessary
