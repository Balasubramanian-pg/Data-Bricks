> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 75. How Notebooks Attach to Clusters exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of notebooks attaching to clusters is to provide a scalable, distributed computing environment for data scientists and researchers to work on complex projects. The problem space includes the need for efficient resource allocation, simplified collaboration, and enhanced productivity. Notebooks attached to clusters enable users to leverage the power of distributed computing, access large datasets, and utilize specialized hardware such as GPUs, all while working in a familiar, interactive environment.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual model of notebooks attaching to clusters involves a client-server architecture, where the notebook serves as the client and the cluster acts as the server. The notebook provides an interactive interface for users to write code, visualize data, and collaborate with others, while the cluster provides the necessary computational resources, storage, and networking infrastructure. The attachment process involves establishing a secure connection between the notebook and the cluster, configuring the environment, and allocating resources.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Notebook | A web-based interactive computing environment that allows users to write and execute code, visualize data, and collaborate with others. |
| Cluster | A group of computers or nodes that work together to provide a scalable, distributed computing environment. |
| Attachment | The process of connecting a notebook to a cluster, enabling the notebook to leverage the cluster's resources and services. |
| Kernel | The computational engine that executes code in a notebook, often running on a cluster node. |
| Resource Allocation | The process of assigning computational resources, such as CPUs, GPUs, and memory, to a notebook or kernel. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of notebooks attaching to clusters include:
* **Decoupling**: The separation of the notebook interface from the computational resources, allowing for greater flexibility and scalability.
* **Resource virtualization**: The abstraction of physical resources, such as CPUs and GPUs, into virtual resources that can be allocated and managed by the cluster.
* **Distributed computing**: The ability to execute code and process data across multiple nodes in the cluster, enabling scalable and parallel computing.
* **Security and authentication**: The mechanisms for securing the connection between the notebook and the cluster, and authenticating users and their access to resources.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for notebooks attaching to clusters involves the following components:
* **Notebook server**: A web-based server that hosts the notebook interface and manages user interactions.
* **Cluster manager**: A system that manages the cluster's resources, schedules jobs, and allocates resources to notebooks.
* **Kernel manager**: A system that manages the kernels running on the cluster nodes, providing a interface for notebooks to execute code.
* **Resource manager**: A system that manages the allocation and deallocation of resources, such as CPUs, GPUs, and memory, to notebooks and kernels.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for notebooks attaching to clusters include:
* **Single-user notebooks**: A single user working on a notebook attached to a cluster, often for personal projects or research.
* **Multi-user notebooks**: Multiple users collaborating on a notebook attached to a cluster, often for team projects or educational purposes.
* **Notebook pooling**: Multiple notebooks sharing a pool of resources on a cluster, enabling efficient resource utilization and reduced costs.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for notebooks attaching to clusters include:
* **Over-allocation**: Allocating more resources than necessary to a notebook, leading to wasted resources and increased costs.
* **Under-allocation**: Allocating insufficient resources to a notebook, leading to performance issues and decreased productivity.
* **Insecure connections**: Failing to secure the connection between the notebook and the cluster, exposing sensitive data and compromising security.
