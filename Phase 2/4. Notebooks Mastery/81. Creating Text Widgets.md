> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 81. Creating Text Widgets exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of creating text widgets is to provide a user interface component that displays text to the user. This addresses the problem of presenting information to the user in a clear and readable format. Text widgets are a fundamental component in graphical user interfaces, and their creation is essential for building effective and user-friendly applications.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of creating text widgets involves understanding the basic components and properties of a text widget, such as the text itself, font, color, and layout. It also involves considering the context in which the text widget will be used, including the platform, device, and user interface guidelines.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Text Widget | A user interface component that displays text to the user. |
| Font | A set of characters of a specific design and style used to display text. |
| Layout | The arrangement of text and other elements within a text widget. |
| Rendering | The process of drawing the text and other elements of a text widget on the screen. |
| Accessibility | The degree to which a text widget can be used by people with disabilities. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of creating text widgets include understanding the properties of text, such as font, size, color, and style, as well as the layout and rendering of text. It also involves considering the accessibility of the text widget, including support for screen readers and other assistive technologies.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for creating text widgets involves using a combination of platform-specific APIs and cross-platform frameworks to create a text widget that is consistent with the underlying platform's user interface guidelines. This includes using standard font and color schemes, as well as following established layout and rendering conventions.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for creating text widgets include using a single font and color scheme throughout the application, using headings and subheadings to organize content, and using whitespace to improve readability. Additionally, many applications use standard text widget components, such as labels, buttons, and text fields, to provide a consistent user interface.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for creating text widgets include using too many different fonts or color schemes, which can create a confusing and inconsistent user interface. Additionally, using text widgets that are too small or too large can make the application difficult to use, and using inadequate whitespace can make the text difficult to read.
