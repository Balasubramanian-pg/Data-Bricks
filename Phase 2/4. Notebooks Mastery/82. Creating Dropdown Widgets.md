## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 82. Creating Dropdown Widgets exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of creating dropdown widgets is to provide users with a compact and intuitive way to select from a list of options, thereby addressing the problem of cluttered user interfaces and improving overall user experience. Dropdown widgets are particularly useful when dealing with long lists of options, as they conserve screen real estate and reduce visual noise.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
A dropdown widget is a graphical user interface element that displays a list of options when clicked or tapped. It typically consists of a text label, a toggle button, and a dropdown menu. The text label displays the currently selected option, while the toggle button allows users to expand or collapse the dropdown menu. The dropdown menu contains a list of available options, from which users can select one or multiple items.
