Canonical documentation for 76. Cluster Detachment Behavior. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 76. Cluster Detachment Behavior exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The Cluster Detachment Behavior is designed to address the challenges of managing and maintaining clusters in distributed systems, particularly in scenarios where nodes or clusters need to be detached or removed from the overall system. This behavior is crucial in ensuring the stability, scalability, and reliability of the system, as it enables the graceful removal of faulty or unwanted nodes, reduces the risk of data loss or corruption, and minimizes the impact on overall system performance.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The Cluster Detachment Behavior can be conceptualized as a coordinated process that involves the systematic disconnection of a node or cluster from the larger system, while ensuring that all necessary steps are taken to maintain data consistency, node integrity, and system stability. This process typically involves a series of sequential and parallel actions, including node isolation, data migration, connection termination, and node removal.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Cluster | A group of nodes that work together to provide a shared resource or service. |
| Node | An individual component or machine within a cluster. |
| Detachment | The process of removing a node or cluster from the overall system. |
| Isolation | The act of separating a node or cluster from the rest of the system to prevent data loss or corruption. |
| Migration | The process of transferring data or responsibilities from a detached node or cluster to another part of the system. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts underlying the Cluster Detachment Behavior include:
* **Node autonomy**: The ability of individual nodes to operate independently and make decisions based on local information.
* **Cluster cohesion**: The degree to which nodes within a cluster work together to achieve a common goal.
* **System resilience**: The ability of the overall system to withstand failures, errors, or other disruptions.
* **Data consistency**: The requirement that data remains accurate, complete, and consistent across the system, even in the face of node detachment or failure.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Cluster Detachment Behavior involves the following steps:
1. **Node selection**: Identify the node or cluster to be detached.
2. **Isolation**: Isolate the selected node or cluster from the rest of the system.
3. **Data migration**: Migrate data or responsibilities from the detached node or cluster to another part of the system.
4. **Connection termination**: Terminate connections between the detached node or cluster and the rest of the system.
5. **Node removal**: Remove the detached node or cluster from the system.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for Cluster Detachment Behavior include:
* **Graceful degradation**: The ability of the system to continue operating, albeit with reduced capacity or functionality, in the event of node detachment or failure.
* **Load balancing**: The distribution of workload or traffic across multiple nodes or clusters to ensure efficient use of resources and minimize the impact of node detachment.
* **Redundancy**: The use of duplicate nodes or clusters to provide failover capability and ensure system availability in the event of node detachment or failure.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for Cluster Detachment Behavior include:
* **Forced termination**: Abruptly terminating connections or removing nodes without proper isolation or data migration, leading to data loss or corruption.
* **Insufficient testing**: Failing to thoroughly test the detachment process, leading to unexpected errors or system instability.
* **Inadequate monitoring**: Failing to monitor system performance or node health, leading to delayed detection of issues or problems.
