# 78. Running All Cells

Canonical documentation for 78. Running All Cells. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 78. Running All Cells exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of Running All Cells is to execute all cells in a notebook or a similar environment, typically for the purpose of data analysis, scientific computing, or other computational tasks. This functionality addresses the problem of manually running each cell individually, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors, especially in large notebooks. By running all cells, users can ensure that their code is executed in the correct order, and they can obtain the desired output without having to intervene manually.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of Running All Cells involves understanding the concept of cells, which are individual units of code that can be executed independently. In a notebook environment, cells are typically arranged in a linear sequence, and each cell can depend on the output of previous cells. Running All Cells involves executing each cell in the sequence, using the output of previous cells as input for subsequent cells. This process can be iterative, with some cells depending on the output of previous cells, and others depending on external data sources.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Cell | A single unit of code that can be executed independently |
| Notebook | A collection of cells arranged in a linear sequence |
| Kernel | The underlying engine that executes the cells |
| Output | The result of executing a cell, which can be used as input for subsequent cells |
| Dependency | A relationship between cells, where the output of one cell is used as input for another cell |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Running All Cells involve understanding the relationships between cells, the dependencies between them, and the order of execution. Additionally, users need to understand how to manage the output of each cell, including handling errors and exceptions. The kernel plays a crucial role in executing the cells, and users need to understand how to configure the kernel to optimize performance.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Running All Cells involves executing each cell in the sequence, using the output of previous cells as input for subsequent cells. This model assumes that the cells are arranged in a linear sequence, and that each cell depends on the output of previous cells. The model also assumes that the kernel is configured to optimize performance, and that errors and exceptions are handled properly.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for Running All Cells include:
* Executing all cells in a notebook to obtain the final output
* Using dependencies to manage the order of execution
* Configuring the kernel to optimize performance
* Handling errors and exceptions using try-except blocks
* Using output cells to display the results of each cell

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for Running All Cells include:
* Manually running each cell individually, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors
* Ignoring dependencies between cells, which can lead to incorrect output
* Not handling errors and exceptions properly, which can lead to crashes or unexpected behavior
* Not configuring the kernel to optimize performance, which can lead to slow execution times
* Not using output cells to display the results of each cell, which can make it difficult to understand the output
